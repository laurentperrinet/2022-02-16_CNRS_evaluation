	Abstract = {We consider the problem of sensorimotor delays in the optimal control of movement under un- certainty. Specifically, we consider axonal conduction delays in the visuo-oculomotor loop and their implications for active inference. Active inference uses a generalisation of Kalman filter- ing to provide Bayes optimal estimates of hidden states and action in generalised coordinates of motion. Representing hidden states in generalised coordinates provides a simple means of compensating for both sensory and oculomotor delays. This compensation is illustrated us- ing neuronal simulations of oculomotor following responses with and without compensation. We then consider an extension of the generative model that produces ocular following to simulate smooth pursuit eye movements --- in which the system believes both the target and its centre of gaze are attracted by a (fictive) point moving in the visual field. Finally, the gen- erative model is equipped with a hierarchical structure, so that it can register and remember unseen (occluded) trajectories and emit anticipatory responses. These simulations speak to a straightforward and neurobiologically plausible solution to the generic problem of integrating information from different sources with different temporal delays and the particular difficulties encountered when a system --- like the oculomotor system --- tries to control its environment with delayed signals.},

@article{Stansbury13,
	Abstract = {During natural vision, humans categorize the scenes they encounter: an office, the beach, and so on. These categories are informed by knowledge of the way that objects co-occur in natural scenes. How does the human brain aggregate information about objects to represent scene categories? To explore this issue, we used statistical learning methods to learn categories that objectively capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in a large collection of natural scenes. Using the learned categories, we modeled {fMRI} brain signals evoked in human subjects when viewing images of scenes. We find that evoked activity across much of anterior visual cortex is explained by the learned categories. Furthermore, a decoder based on these scene categories accurately predicts the categories and objects comprising novel scenes from brain activity evoked by those scenes. These results suggest that the human brain represents scene categories that capture the co-occurrence statistics of objects in the world. "Brain activity encodes scene categories that reflect real-world object {statistics"These} scene categories are represented in many anterior visual regions of {interest"Scene} categories and individual objects can be decoded from measured brain activity {fMRI} signals contain more information about categories than previously appreciated Object context influences human scene categorization, but an objective explanation of this phenomenon has been absent.

@article{Samu14,
	Abstract = {In the past two decades some fundamental properties of cortical connectivity have been discovered: small-world structure, pronounced hierarchical and modular organisation, and strong core and rich-club structures. A common assumption when interpreting results of this kind is that the observed structural properties are present to enable the brain's function. However, the brain is also embedded into the limited space of the skull and its wiring has associated developmental and metabolic costs. These basic physical and economic aspects place separate, often conflicting, constraints on the brain's connectivity, which must be characterized in order to understand the true relationship between brain structure and function. To address this challenge, here we ask which, and to what extent, aspects of the structural organisation of the brain are conserved if we preserve specific spatial and topological properties of the brain but otherwise randomise its connectivity. We perform a comparative analysis of a connectivity map of the cortical connectome both on high- and low-resolutions utilising three different types of surrogate networks: spatially unconstrained ('random'), connection length preserving ('spatial'), and connection length optimised ('reduced') surrogates. We find that unconstrained randomisation markedly diminishes all investigated architectural properties of cortical connectivity. By contrast, spatial and reduced surrogates largely preserve most properties and, interestingly, often more so in the reduced surrogates. Specifically, our results suggest that the cortical network is less tightly integrated than its spatial constraints would allow, but more strongly segregated than its spatial constraints would necessitate. We additionally find that hierarchical organisation and rich-club structure of the cortical connectivity are largely preserved in spatial and reduced surrogates and hence may be partially attributable to cortical wiring constraints. In contrast, the high modularity and strong s-core of the high-resolution cortical network are significantly stronger than in the surrogates, underlining their potential functional relevance in the brain. Macroscopic regions in the grey matter of the human brain are intricately connected by white-matter pathways, forming the extremely complex network of the brain. Analysing this brain network may provide us insights on how anatomy enables brain function and, ultimately, cognition and consciousness. Various important principles of organization have indeed been consistently identified in the brain's structural connectivity, such as a small-world and modular architecture. However, it is currently unclear which of these principles are functionally relevant, and which are merely the consequence of more basic constraints of the brain, such as its three-dimensional spatial embedding into the limited volume of the skull or the high metabolic cost of long-range connections. In this paper, we model what aspects of the structural organization of the brain are affected by its wiring constraints by assessing how far these aspects are preserved in brain-like networks with varying spatial wiring constraints. We find that all investigated features of brain organization also appear in spatially constrained networks, but we also discover that several of the features are more pronounced in the brain than its wiring constraints alone would necessitate. These findings suggest the functional relevance of the 'over-expressed' properties of brain architecture.},

realistic temporal dynamics in hardware neural processing architectures; we
review the challenges of realizing spike-based plasticity mechanisms in real
physical systems and present examples of analog electronic circuits that
implement them; we describe the computational properties of recurrent neural

	Abstract = {In addition to motion perception per se, we utilize motion information for a wide range of brain functions. These varied functions place different demands on the visual system, and therefore a stimulus that provides useful information for one function may be inadequate for another. For example, the direction of motion of large high-contrast stimuli is difficult to discriminate perceptually, but other studies have shown that such stimuli are highly effective at eliciting directional oculomotor responses such as the ocular following response ({OFR}). Here, we investigated the degree of independence between perceptual and oculomotor processing by determining whether perceptually suppressed moving stimuli can nonetheless evoke reliable eye movements. We measured reflexively evoked tracking eye movements while observers discriminated the motion direction of large high-contrast stimuli. To quantify the discrimination ability of the oculomotor system, we used signal detection theory to generate associated oculometric functions. The results showed that oculomotor sensitivity to motion direction is not predicted by perceptual sensitivity to the same stimuli. In fact, in several cases oculomotor responses were more reliable than perceptual responses. Moreover, a trial-by-trial analysis indicated that, for stimuli tested in this study, oculomotor processing was statistically independent from perceptual processing. Evidently, perceptual and oculomotor responses reflect the activity of independent dissociable mechanisms despite operating on the same input. While results of this kind have traditionally been interpreted in the framework of perception versus action, we propose that these differences reflect a more general principle of modularity.},

	Abstract = {Biophysically detailed models of single cells are difficult to fit to real data. Recent advances in imaging techniques allow simultaneous access to various intracellular variables, and these data can be used to significantly facilitate the modelling task. These data, however, are noisy, and current approaches to building biophysically detailed models are not designed to deal with this. We extend previous techniques to take the noisy nature of the measurements into account. Sequential Monte Carlo ( '' particle filtering'') methods, in combination with a detailed biophysical description of a cell, are used for principled, model-based smoothing of noisy recording data. We also provide an alternative formulation of smoothing where the neural nonlinearities are estimated in a non-parametric manner. Biophysically important parameters of detailed models (such as channel densities, intercompartmental conductances, input resistances, and observation noise) are inferred automatically from noisy data via expectation-maximisation. Overall, we find that model-based smoothing is a powerful, robust technique for smoothing of noisy biophysical data and for inference of biophysical parameters in the face of recording noise. Cellular imaging techniques are maturing at a great pace, but are still plagued by high levels of noise. Here, we present two methods for smoothing individual, noisy traces. The first method fits a full, biophysically accurate description of the cell under study to the noisy data. This allows both smoothing of the data and inference of biophysically relevant parameters such as the density of (active) channels, input resistance, intercompartmental conductances, and noise levels; it does, however, depend on knowledge of active channel kinetics. The second method achieves smoothing of noisy traces by fitting arbitrary kinetics in a non-parametric manner. Both techniques can additionally be used to infer unobserved variables, for instance voltage from calcium concentration. This paper gives a detailed account of the methods and should allow for straightforward modification and inclusion of additional measurements.},

Identifying which neurons and circuits control which behaviors has been a laborious piecemeal process, usually for one observer-defined behavior at a time. We present a fundamentally different approach to neuron-behavior mapping. We optogenetically activated 1,054 identified neuron lines in Drosophila larva and tracked the behavioral responses from 37,780 animals. Applying multiscale unsupervised structure learning methods to the behavioral data identified 29 discrete statistically distinguishable and observer-unbiased behavioral phenotypes. Mapping the neural lines to the behavior(s) they evoke provides a behavioral reference atlas for neuron subsets covering a large fraction of larval neurons. This atlas is a starting point for connectivity- and activity-mapping studies to further investigate the mechanisms by which neurons mediate diverse behaviors.},

                A comprehensive picture of object processing in the human brain requires combining both spatial and temporal information about brain activity. Here we acquired human magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) responses to 92 object images. Multivariate pattern classification applied to {MEG} revealed the time course of object processing: whereas individual images were discriminated by visual representations early, ordinate and superordinate category levels emerged relatively late. Using representational similarity analysis, we combined human {fMRI} and {MEG} to show content-specific correspondence between early {MEG} responses and primary visual cortex (V1), and later {MEG} responses and inferior temporal ({IT}) cortex. We identified transient and persistent neural activities during object processing with sources in V1 and {IT}. Finally, we correlated human {MEG} signals to single-unit responses in monkey {IT}. Together, our findings provide an integrated space- and time-resolved view of human object categorization during the first few hundred milliseconds of vision.

	Abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements are important for vision because they maintain the line of sight on targets that move smoothly within the visual field. Smooth pursuit is driven by neural representations of motion, including a surprisingly strong influence of high-level signals representing expected motion. We studied anticipatory smooth eye movements (defined as smooth eye movements in the direction of expected future motion) produced by salient visual cues in a group of high-functioning observers with Autism Spectrum Disorder ({ASD}), a condition that has been associated with difficulties in either generating predictions, or translating predictions into effective motor commands. Eye movements were recorded while participants pursued the motion of a disc that moved within an outline drawing of an inverted Y-shaped tube. The cue to the motion path was a visual barrier that blocked the untraveled branch (right or left) of the tube. {ASD} participants showed strong anticipatory smooth eye movements whose velocity was the same as that of a group of neurotypical participants. Anticipatory smooth eye movements appeared on the very first cued trial, indicating that trial-by-trial learning was not responsible for the responses. These results are significant because they show that anticipatory capacities are intact in high-functioning {ASD} in cases where the cue to the motion path is highly salient and unambiguous. Once the ability to generate anticipatory pursuit is demonstrated, the study of the anticipatory responses with a variety of types of cues provides a window into the perceptual or cognitive processes that underlie the interpretation of events in natural environments or social situations.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers the Cartesian theatre as a metaphor for the virtual reality models that the brain uses to make inferences about the world. This treatment derives from our attempts to understand dreaming and waking consciousness in terms of free energy minimization. The idea here
 is that the Cartesian theatre is not observed by an internal (homuncular) audience but furnishes a theatre in which fictive narratives and fantasies can be rehearsed and tested against sensory evidence. We suppose the brain is driven by the imperative to infer the causes of its sensory samples;
 in much the same way as scientists are compelled to test hypotheses about experimental data. This recapitulates Helmholtz's notion of unconscious inference and Gregory's treatment of perception as hypothesis testing. However, we take this further and consider the active sampling
 of the world as the gathering of confirmatory evidence for hypotheses based on our virtual reality. The ensuing picture of consciousness (or active inference) resolves a number of seemingly hard problems in consciousness research and is internally consistent with current thinking in systems
 neuroscience and theoretical neurobiology. In this formalism, there is a dualism that distinguishes between the (conscious) process of inference and the (material) process that entails inference. This separation is reflected by the distinction between beliefs (probability distributions over
 hidden world states or res cogitans) and the physical brain states (sufficient statistics or res extensa) that encode them. This formal approach allows us to appeal to simple but fundamental theorems in information theory and statistical thermodynamics that dissolve some of the mysterious
 aspects of consciousness.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the spectrum of certain integro-differential-delay equations ({IDDEs}) which arise naturally within spatially distributed, nonlocal, pattern formation problems. Our approach is based on the reformulation of the relevant dispersion relations with the use of the Lambert function. As a particular application of this approach, we consider the case of the Amari delay neural field equation which describes the local activity of a population of neurons taking into consideration the finite propagation speed of the electric signal. We show that if the kernel appearing in this equation is symmetric around some point a ≠0 or consists of a sum of such terms, then the relevant dispersion relation yields spectra with an infinite number of branches, as opposed to finite sets of eigenvalues considered in previous works. Also, in earlier works the focus has been on the most rightward part of the spectrum and the possibility of an instability driven pattern formation. Here, we numerically survey the structure of the entire spectra and argue that a detailed knowledge of this structure is important within neurodynamical applications. Indeed, the Amari {IDDE} acts as a filter with the ability to recognise and respond whenever it is excited in such a way so as to resonate with one of its rightward modes, thereby amplifying such inputs and dampening others. Finally, we discuss how these results can be generalised to the case of systems of {IDDEs}.},

	Abstract = {A key component of computational biology is to compare the results of computer modelling with experimental measurements. Despite substantial progress in the models and algorithms used in many areas of computational biology, such comparisons sometimes reveal that the computations are not in quantitative agreement with experimental data. The principle of maximum entropy is a general procedure for constructing probability distributions in the light of new data, making it a natural tool in cases when an initial model provides results that are at odds with experiments. The number of maximum entropy applications in our field has grown steadily in recent years, in areas as diverse as sequence analysis, structural modelling, and neurobiology. In this Perspectives article, we give a broad introduction to the method, in an attempt to encourage its further adoption. The general procedure is explained in the context of a simple example, after which we proceed with a real-world application in the field of molecular simulations, where the maximum entropy procedure has recently provided new insight. Given the limited accuracy of force fields, macromolecular simulations sometimes produce results that are at not in complete and quantitative accordance with experiments. A common solution to this problem is to explicitly ensure agreement between the two by perturbing the potential energy function towards the experimental data. So far, a general consensus for how such perturbations should be implemented has been lacking. Three very recent papers have explored this problem using the maximum entropy approach, providing both new theoretical and practical insights to the problem. We highlight each of these contributions in turn and conclude with a discussion on remaining challenges.},

	Abstract = {Self-motion, steering, and obstacle avoidance during navigation in the real world require humans to travel along curved paths. Many perceptual models have been proposed that focus on heading, which specifies the direction of travel along straight paths, but not on path curvature, which humans accurately perceive and is critical to everyday locomotion. In primates, including humans, dorsal medial superior temporal area ({MSTd}) has been implicated in heading perception. However, the majority of {MSTd} neurons respond optimally to spiral patterns, rather than to the radial expansion patterns associated with heading. No existing theory of curved path perception explains the neural mechanisms by which humans accurately assess path and no functional role for spiral-tuned cells has yet been proposed. Here we present a computational model that demonstrates how the continuum of observed cells (radial to circular) in {MSTd} can simultaneously code curvature and heading across the neural population. Curvature is encoded through the spirality of the most active cell, and heading is encoded through the visuotopic location of the center of the most active cell's receptive field. Model curvature and heading errors fit those made by humans. Our model challenges the view that the function of {MSTd} is heading estimation, based on our analysis we claim that it is primarily concerned with trajectory estimation and the simultaneous representation of both curvature and heading. In our model, temporal dynamics afford time-history in the neural representation of optic flow, which may modulate its structure. This has far-reaching implications for the interpretation of studies that assume that optic flow is, and should be, represented as an instantaneous vector field. Our results suggest that spiral motion patterns that emerge in spatio-temporal optic flow are essential for guiding self-motion along complex trajectories, and that cells in {MSTd} are specifically tuned to extract complex trajectory estimation from flow. Much human and primate psychological and electrophysiological research on visually-guided navigation has focused on heading perception, defined as the instantaneous direction of travel. However, the perception of path of travel, or trajectory, is arguably more important, because it informs in a more general sense whether the observer is on a collision course with moving objects or will intercept a target. In the present article, we describe a theory based on physiological evidence of how primate visual area {MSTd} may simultaneously and dynamically encode heading and path. The model connects many different sources of data, including psychophysics on human perception of heading and path with and without eye movements, and primate electrophysiological data on path-selective cells in {MSTd}. We propose neural mechanisms explaining why humans report traveling along curved paths when the display represents a straight path with simulated eye rotations. We predict that perceptual sensitivity to heading and path emerges in primate {MSTd} through the dynamical and competitive interactions between neurons tuned to the continuum of spiral-radial patterns.},

and suboptimal Bayesian algorithms for {nonlinear/non-Gaussian} tracking
problems, with a focus on particle filters. Particle filters are
sequential Monte Carlo methods based on point mass (or "particle")
representations of probability densities, which can be applied to any
state-space model and which generalize the traditional Kalman filtering
methods. Several variants of the particle filter such as {SIR}, {ASIR}, and
{RPF} are introduced within a generic framework of the sequential
importance sampling ({SIS}) algorithm. These are discussed and compared
with the standard {EKF} through an illustrative example},

	Abstract = {
                Using olfactory molecular specificity, we examined the inheritance of parental traumatic exposure, a phenomenon that has been frequently observed, but not understood. We subjected F0 mice to odor fear conditioning before conception and found that subsequently conceived F1 and F2 generations had an increased behavioral sensitivity to the F0-conditioned odor, but not to other odors. When an odor (acetophenone) that activates a known odorant receptor (Olfr151) was used to condition F0 mice, the behavioral sensitivity of the F1 and F2 generations to acetophenone was complemented by an enhanced neuroanatomical representation of the Olfr151 pathway. Bisulfite sequencing of sperm {DNA} from conditioned F0 males and F1 naive offspring revealed {CpG} hypomethylation in the Olfr151 gene. In addition, in vitro fertilization, F2 inheritance and cross-fostering revealed that these transgenerational effects are inherited via parental gametes. Our findings provide a framework for addressing how environmental information may be inherited transgenerationally at behavioral, neuroanatomical and epigenetic levels.

	Abstract = {Motion signals in the visual field can cause strong biases in the perceived positions of stationary objects. Local motion signal within an object induces a shift in the perceived object position in the direction of motion, whereas adaptation to motion stimuli causes a perceptual shift in the opposite direction. The neural mechanisms underlying these illusions are poorly understood. Here we report two novel receptive field ({RF}) properties in cat primary visual cortex that may account for these motion-position illusions. First, motion signal in a stationary test stimulus causes a displacement of the {RF} in the direction opposite to motion. Second, motion adaptation induces a shift of the {RF} in the direction of adaptation. Comparison with human psychophysical measurements under similar conditions indicates that these {RF} properties can primarily account for the motion-position illusions. Importantly, both {RF} properties indicate a spatial asymmetry in the synaptic connections from direction-selective cells, and this circuit feature can be predicted by spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity, a widespread phenomenon in the nervous system. Thus, motion-induced perceptual mislocalization may be mediated by asymmetric cortical circuits, as a natural consequence of experience-dependent synaptic modification during circuit development.},

@article{citeulike:12890257,
	Abstract = {Maximum entropy models are the least structured probability distributions that exactly reproduce a chosen set of statistics measured in an interacting network. Here we use this principle to construct probabilistic models which describe the correlated spiking activity of populations of up to 120 neurons in the salamander retina as it responds to natural movies. Already in groups as small as 10 neurons, interactions between spikes can no longer be regarded as small perturbations in an otherwise independent system; for 40 or more neurons pairwise interactions need to be supplemented by a global interaction that controls the distribution of synchrony in the population. Here we show that such  '' K-pairwise'' models---being systematic extensions of the previously used pairwise Ising models---provide an excellent account of the data. We explore the properties of the neural vocabulary by: 1) estimating its entropy, which constrains the population's capacity to represent visual information; 2) classifying activity patterns into a small set of metastable collective modes; 3) showing that the neural codeword ensembles are extremely inhomogenous; 4) demonstrating that the state of individual neurons is highly predictable from the rest of the population, allowing the capacity for error correction. Sensory neurons encode information about the world into sequences of spiking and silence. Multi-electrode array recordings have enabled us to move from single units to measuring the responses of many neurons simultaneously, and thus to ask questions about how populations of neurons as a whole represent their input signals. Here we build on previous work that has shown that in the salamander retina, pairs of retinal ganglion cells are only weakly correlated, yet the population spiking activity exhibits large departures from a model where the neurons would be independent. We analyze data from more than a hundred salamander retinal ganglion cells and characterize their collective response using maximum entropy models of statistical physics. With these models in hand, we can put bounds on the amount of information encoded by the neural population, constructively demonstrate that the code has error correcting redundancy, and advance two hypotheses about the neural code: that collective states of the network could carry stimulus information, and that the distribution of neural activity patterns has very nontrivial statistical properties, possibly related to critical systems in statistical physics.},

Many sophisticated models for behavioural and neurobiological data have flourished during the past decade. Most of these models are partly unspecified (i.e. they have unknown parameters) and nonlinear. This makes them difficult to peer with a formal statistical data analysis framework. In turn, this compromises the reproducibility of model-based empirical studies. This work exposes a software toolbox that provides generic, efficient and robust probabilistic solutions to the three problems of model-based analysis of empirical data: (i) data simulation, (ii) parameter estimation/model selection, and (iii) experimental design optimization.},

	Abstract = {The aging brain shows a progressive loss of neuropil, which is accompanied by subtle changes in neuronal plasticity, sensory learning and memory. Neurophysiologically, aging attenuates evoked responses---including the mismatch negativity ({MMN}). This is accompanied by a shift in cortical responsivity from sensory (posterior) regions to executive (anterior) regions, which has been interpreted as a compensatory response for cognitive decline. Theoretical neurobiology offers a simpler explanation for all of these effects---from a Bayesian perspective, as the brain is progressively optimized to model its world, its complexity will decrease. A corollary of this complexity reduction is an attenuation of Bayesian updating or sensory learning. Here we confirmed this hypothesis using magnetoencephalographic recordings of the mismatch negativity elicited in a large cohort of human subjects, in their third to ninth decade. Employing dynamic causal modeling to assay the synaptic mechanisms underlying these non-invasive recordings, we found a selective age-related attenuation of synaptic connectivity changes that underpin rapid sensory learning. In contrast, baseline synaptic connectivity strengths were consistently strong over the decades. Our findings suggest that the lifetime accrual of sensory experience optimizes functional brain architectures to enable efficient and generalizable predictions of the world. While studies of aging are widely framed in terms of their demarcation of degenerative processes, the brain provides a unique opportunity to uncover the adaptive effects of getting older. Though intuitively reasonable, that life-experience and wisdom should reside somewhere in human cortex, these features have eluded neuroscientific explanation. The present study utilizes a  '' Bayesian Brain'' framework to motivate an analysis of cortical circuit processing. From a Bayesian perspective, the brain represents a model of its environment and offers predictions about the world, while responding, through changing synaptic strengths to novel interactions and experiences. We hypothesized that these predictive and updating processes are modified as we age, representing an optimization of neuronal architecture. Using novel sensory stimuli we demonstrate that synaptic connections of older brains resist trial by trial learning to provide a robust model of their sensory environment. These older brains are capable of processing a wider range of sensory inputs -- representing experienced generalists. We thus explain how, contrary to a singularly degenerative point-of-view, aging neurobiological effects may be understood, in sanguine terms, as adaptive and useful.},

	Abstract = {Motor skills improve with age from childhood into adulthood and this improvement is reflected in the performance of smooth pursuit eye movements. In contrast, the saccadic system becomes mature earlier than the smooth pursuit system. Therefore, the present study investigates whether the early mature saccadic system compensates for the lower pursuit performance during childhood. To answer this question, horizontal eye movements were recorded in 58 children (ages 5-16) and 16 adults (ages 23-36) in a task that required the combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements. Smooth pursuit performance improved with age. However, children had larger average position error during target tracking compared to adults but they did not execute more saccades to compensate for their low pursuit performance despite the early maturity of their saccadic system. This absence of error correction suggests that children have a lower sensitivity to visual errors compared to adults. This reduced sensitivity might stem from poor internal models and longer processing time in young children.},

	Abstract = {The visual system is exquisitely adapted to the task of extracting conceptual information from visual input with every new eye fixation, three or four times a second. Here we assess the minimum viewing time needed for visual comprehension, using rapid serial visual presentation ({RSVP}) of a series of six or 12 pictures presented at between 13 and 80 ms per picture, with no interstimulus interval. Participants were to detect a picture specified by a name (e.g., smiling couple) that was given just before or immediately after the sequence. Detection improved with increasing duration and was better when the name was presented before the sequence, but performance was significantly above chance at all durations, whether the target was named before or only after the sequence. The results are consistent with feedforward models, in which an initial wave of neural activity through the ventral stream is sufficient to allow identification of a complex visual stimulus in a single forward pass. Although we discuss other explanations, the results suggest that neither reentrant processing from higher to lower levels nor advance information about the stimulus is necessary for the conscious detection of rapidly presented, complex visual information.},

	Abstract = {Normal perception involves experiencing objects within perceptual scenes as real, as existing in the world. This property of ?perceptual presence? has motivated ?sensorimotor theories? which understand perception to involve the mastery of sensorimotor contingencies. However, the mechanistic basis of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery has remained unclear. Sensorimotor theory also struggles to explain instances of perception, such as synesthesia, that appear to lack perceptual presence and for which relevant sensorimotor contingencies are difficult to identify. On alternative ?predictive processing? theories, perceptual content emerges from probabilistic inference on the external causes of sensory signals, however, this view has addressed neither the problem of perceptual presence nor synesthesia. Here, I describe a theory of predictive perception of sensorimotor contingencies which (1) accounts for perceptual presence in normal perception, as well as its absence in synesthesia, and (2) operationalizes the notion of sensorimotor contingencies and their mastery. The core idea is that generative models underlying perception incorporate explicitly counterfactual elements related to how sensory inputs would change on the basis of a broad repertoire of possible actions, even if those actions are not performed. These ?counterfactually-rich? generative models encode sensorimotor contingencies related to repertoires of sensorimotor dependencies, with counterfactual richness determining the degree of perceptual presence associated with a stimulus. While the generative models underlying normal perception are typically counterfactually rich (reflecting a large repertoire of possible sensorimotor dependencies), those underlying synesthetic concurrents are hypothesized to be counterfactually poor. In addition to accounting for the phenomenology of synesthesia, the theory naturally accommodates phenomenological differences between a range of experiential states including dreaming, hallucination, and the like. It may also lead to a new view of the (in)determinacy of normal perception.},

	Abstract = {Almost all research work in computational neuroscience involves software. As researchers try to understand ever more complex systems, there is a continual need for software with new capabilities. Because of the wide range of questions being investigated, new software is often developed rapidly by individuals or small groups. In these cases, it can be hard to demonstrate that the software gives the right results. Software developers are often open about the code they produce and willing to share it, but there is little appreciation among potential users of the great diversity of software development practices and end results, and how this affects the suitability of software tools for use in research projects. To help clarify these issues, we have reviewed a range of software tools and asked how the culture and practice of software development affects their validity and trustworthiness. We identified four key questions that can be used to categorize software projects and correlate them with the type of product that results. The first question addresses what is being produced. The other three concern why, how, and by whom the work is done. The answers to these questions show strong correlations with the nature of the software being produced, and its suitability for particular purposes. Based on our findings, we suggest ways in which current software development practice in computational neuroscience can be improved and propose checklists to help developers, reviewers, and scientists to assess the quality of software and whether particular pieces of software are ready for use in research.},

	Abstract = {Information is encoded in neural circuits using both graded and action potentials, converting between them within single neurons and successive processing layers. This conversion is accompanied by information loss and a drop in energy efficiency. We investigate the biophysical causes of this loss of information and efficiency by comparing spiking neuron models, containing stochastic voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels, with generator potential and graded potential models lacking voltage-gated Na+ channels. We identify three causes of information loss in the generator potential that are the by-product of action potential generation: (1) the voltage-gated Na+ channels necessary for action potential generation increase intrinsic noise and (2) introduce non-linearities, and (3) the finite duration of the action potential creates a 'footprint' in the generator potential that obscures incoming signals. These three processes reduce information rates by \~{}50\% in generator potentials, to \~{}3 times that of spike trains. Both generator potentials and graded potentials consume almost an order of magnitude less energy per second than spike trains. Because of the lower information rates of generator potentials they are substantially less energy efficient than graded potentials. However, both are an order of magnitude more efficient than spike trains due to the higher energy costs and low information content of spikes, emphasizing that there is a two-fold cost of converting analogue to digital; information loss and cost inflation. As in electronics, many of the brain's neural circuits convert continuous time signals into a discrete-time binary code. Although some neurons use only graded voltage signals, most convert these signals into discrete-time action potentials. Yet the costs and benefits associated with such a switch in signalling mechanism are largely unexplored. We investigate why the conversion of graded potentials to action potentials is accompanied by substantial information loss and how this changes energy efficiency. Action potentials are generated by a large cohort of noisy Na+ channels. We show that this channel noise and the added non-linearity of Na+ channels destroy input information provided by graded generator potentials. Furthermore, action potentials themselves cause information loss due to their finite widths because the neuron is oblivious to the input that is arriving during an action potential. Consequently, neurons with high firing rates lose a large amount of the information in their inputs. The additional cost incurred by voltage-gated Na+ channels also means that action potentials can encode less information per unit energy, proving metabolically inefficient, and suggesting penalisation of high firing rates in the nervous system.},

	Abstract = {Correlated neuronal activity is a natural consequence of network connectivity and shared inputs to pairs of neurons, but the task-dependent modulation of correlations in relation to behavior also hints at a functional role. Correlations influence the gain of postsynaptic neurons, the amount of information encoded in the population activity and decoded by readout neurons, and synaptic plasticity. Further, it affects the power and spatial reach of extracellular signals like the local-field potential. A theory of correlated neuronal activity accounting for recurrent connectivity as well as fluctuating external sources is currently lacking. In particular, it is unclear how the recently found mechanism of active decorrelation by negative feedback on the population level affects the network response to externally applied correlated stimuli. Here, we present such an extension of the theory of correlations in stochastic binary networks. We show that (1) for homogeneous external input, the structure of correlations is mainly determined by the local recurrent connectivity, (2) homogeneous external inputs provide an additive, unspecific contribution to the correlations, (3) inhibitory feedback effectively decorrelates neuronal activity, even if neurons receive identical external inputs, and (4) identical synaptic input statistics to excitatory and to inhibitory cells increases intrinsically generated fluctuations and pairwise correlations. We further demonstrate how the accuracy of mean-field predictions can be improved by self-consistently including correlations. As a byproduct, we show that the cancellation of correlations between the summed inputs to pairs of neurons does not originate from the fast tracking of external input, but from the suppression of fluctuations on the population level by the local network. This suppression is a necessary constraint, but not sufficient to determine the structure of correlations; specifically, the structure observed at finite network size differs from the prediction based on perfect tracking, even though perfect tracking implies suppression of population fluctuations. The co-occurrence of action potentials of pairs of neurons within short time intervals has been known for a long time. Such synchronous events can appear time-locked to the behavior of an animal, and also theoretical considerations argue for a functional role of synchrony. Early theoretical work tried to explain correlated activity by neurons transmitting common fluctuations due to shared inputs. This, however, overestimates correlations. Recently, the recurrent connectivity of cortical networks was shown responsible for the observed low baseline correlations. Two different explanations were given: One argues that excitatory and inhibitory population activities closely follow the external inputs to the network, so that their effects on a pair of cells mutually cancel. Another explanation relies on negative recurrent feedback to suppress fluctuations in the population activity, equivalent to small correlations. In a biological neuronal network one expects both, external inputs and recurrence, to affect correlated activity. The present work extends the theoretical framework of correlations to include both contributions and explains their qualitative differences. Moreover, the study shows that the arguments of fast tracking and recurrent feedback are not equivalent, only the latter correctly predicts the cell-type specific correlations.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal signal integration and information processing in cortical networks critically depend on the organization of synaptic connectivity. During development, neurons can form synaptic connections when their axonal and dendritic arborizations come within close proximity of each other. Although many signaling cues are thought to be involved in guiding neuronal extensions, the extent to which accidental appositions between axons and dendrites can already account for synaptic connectivity remains unclear. To investigate this, we generated a local network of cortical L2/3 neurons that grew out independently of each other and that were not guided by any extracellular cues. Synapses were formed when axonal and dendritic branches came by chance within a threshold distance of each other. Despite the absence of guidance cues, we found that the emerging synaptic connectivity showed a good agreement with available experimental data on spatial locations of synapses on dendrites and axons, number of synapses by which neurons are connected, connection probability between neurons, distance between connected neurons, and pattern of synaptic connectivity. The connectivity pattern had a small-world topology but was not scale free. Together, our results suggest that baseline synaptic connectivity in local cortical circuits may largely result from accidentally overlapping axonal and dendritic branches of independently outgrowing neurons.},

	Abstract = {This study analyzes how human participants combine saccadic and pursuit gaze movements when they track an oscillating target moving along a randomly oriented straight line with the head free to move. We found that to track the moving target appropriately, participants triggered more saccades with increasing target oscillation frequency to compensate for imperfect tracking gains. Our sinusoidal paradigm allowed us to show that saccade amplitude was better correlated with internal estimates of position and velocity error at saccade onset than with those parameters 100 ms before saccade onset as head-restrained studies have shown. An analysis of saccadic onset time revealed that most of the saccades were triggered when the target was accelerating. Finally, we found that most saccades were triggered when small position errors were combined with large velocity errors at saccade onset. This could explain why saccade amplitude was better correlated with velocity error than with position error. Therefore, our results indicate that the triggering mechanism of head-unrestrained catch-up saccades combines position and velocity error at saccade onset to program and correct saccade amplitude rather than using sensory information 100 ms before saccade onset.},

	Abstract = {The L0-norm constraint in sparse coding has the advantage of producing the same diversity of receptive field shapes as physiology data, but is difficult for analysis. It remains a challenging issue to understand how the diverse shapes of V1 simple cell receptive fields emerge in visual cortex. This paper presents a biologically plausible learning algorithm, named Hebbian-based mean shift, for this problem. The L0-norm constraint optimizes the number of basis functions rather than their coefficients. We report that the optimization procedure is essentially a 0--1 programming of the selection of basis functions. By assuming that the basis functions are independently selected from a basis set, we find the spatial distribution of input samples containing a special basis function has a star shape and peaks at this basis function. Thus, learning the basis functions for sparse coding with the L0-norm can be interpreted as mode detection where the basis functions are the modes of the kernel density estimate. We employ mean shift to detect modes and prove that the updating rule for the mean shift is Hebbian. The simulation results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed algorithm in producing both Gabor-like and blob-like basis functions.},

	Abstract = {Over the history of the study of visual perception there has been great success at discovering countless visual illusions. There has been less success in organizing the overwhelming variety of illusions into empirical generalizations (much less explaining them all via a unifying theory). Here, this article shows that it is possible to systematically organize more than 50 kinds of illusion into a 7 × 4 matrix of 28 classes. In particular, this article demonstrates that (1) smaller sizes, (2) slower speeds, (3) greater luminance contrast, (4) farther distance, (5) lower eccentricity, (6) greater proximity to the vanishing point, and (7) greater proximity to the focus of expansion all tend to have similar perceptual effects, namely, to (A) increase perceived size, (B) increase perceived speed, (C) decrease perceived luminance contrast, and (D) decrease perceived distance. The detection of these empirical regularities was motivated by a hypothesis, called perceiving the present, that the visual system possesses mechanisms for compensating neural delay during forward motion. This article shows how this hypothesis predicts the empirical regularity.},

@article{Hegde08,
	Abstract = {
                Our perception of a visual scene changes rapidly in time, even when the scene itself does not. It is increasingly clear that understanding how the visual percept changes in time is crucial to understanding how we see. We are still far from fully understanding the temporal changes in the visual percept and the neural mechanisms that underlie it. But recently, many disparate lines of evidence are beginning to converge to produce a complex but fuzzy picture of visual temporal dynamics. It is clear, largely from psychophysical studies in humans, that one can get the 'gist' of complex visual scenes within about 150ms after the stimulus onset, even when the stimulus itself is presented as briefly as 10 ms or so. It generally takes longer processing, if not longer stimulus presentation, to identify individual objects. It may take even longer for a fuller semantic understanding, or awareness, of the scene to emerge and be encoded in short-term memory. Microelectrode recording studies in monkeys, along with neuroimaging studies mostly in humans, have elucidated many important temporal dynamic phenomena at the level of individual neurons and neuronal populations. Many of the temporal changes at the perceptual and the neural levels can be captured by the multifaceted and somewhat ambiguous concept of coarse-to-fine processing, although it is clear that not all temporal changes can be characterized this way. A more comprehensive, albeit unproven, alternative framework for understanding visual temporal dynamics is to view it as a sequential, Bayesian decision-making process. At each step, the visual system infers the likely nature visual scene by jointly evaluating the available processed image information and prior knowledge about the scene, including prior inferences. Whether the processing proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion depends largely on whether the underlying computations are hierarchical or not. Characterizing these inferential steps from the computational, perceptual and neural standpoints will be a key part of future work in this emerging field.

                In the flash-lag illusion, a moving object aligned with a flash is perceived to be offset in the direction of motion following the flash. In the "flash-drag" illusion, a flash is mislocalized in the direction of nearby motion. In the "flash-jump" illusion, a transient change in the appearance of a moving object (e.g., color) is mislocalized in the direction of subsequent motion. Finally, in the Frohlich illusion, the starting position of a suddenly appearing moving object is mislocalized in the direction of the subsequent motion. We demonstrate, in a series of experiments, a unified explanation for all these illusions: Perceptual localization is influenced by motion signals collected over approximately 80 ms after a query is triggered. These demonstrations rule out "latency difference" and asynchronous feature binding models, in which objects appear in their real positions but misaligned in time. Instead, the illusions explored here are best understood as biases in localization caused by motion signals. We suggest that motion biasing exists because it allows the visual system to account for neural processing delays by retrospectively "pushing" an object closer to its true physical location, and we propose directions for exploring the neural mechanisms underlying the dynamic updating of location by the activity of motion-sensitive neurons.

	Abstract = {
                The slow speed of neural transmission necessitates that cortical visual information from dynamic scenes will lag reality. The "perceiving the present" ({PTP}) hypothesis suggests that the visual system can mitigate the effect of such delays by spatially warping scenes to look as they will in \~{}100 ms from now (Changizi, 2001). We here show that the Hering illusion, in which straight lines appear bowed, can be induced by a background of optic flow, consistent with the {PTP} hypothesis. However, importantly, the bowing direction is the same whether the flow is inward or outward. This suggests that if the warping is meant to counteract latencies, it is accomplished by a simple strategy that is insensitive to motion direction, and that works only under typical (forward-moving) circumstances. We also find that the illusion strengthens with longer pulses of optic flow, demonstrating motion integration over \~{}80 ms. The illusion is identical whether optic flow precedes or follows the flashing of bars, exposing the spatial warping to be equally postdictive and predictive, i.e., peri-dictive. Additionally, the illusion is diminished by cues which suggest the bars are independent of the background movement. Collectively, our findings are consistent with a role for networks of visual orientation-tuned neurons (e.g., simple cells in primary visual cortex) in spatial warping. We conclude that under the common condition of forward ego-motion, spatial warping counteracts the disadvantage of neural latencies. It is not possible to prove that this is the purpose of spatial warping, but our findings at minimum place constraints on the {PTP} hypothesis, demonstrating that any spatial warping for the purpose of counteracting neural delays is not a precise, on-the-fly computation, but instead a heuristic achieved by a simple mechanism that succeeds under normal circumstances.

	Abstract = {An implicit, underlying assumption of most {Helmholtzian/Bayesian} approaches to perception is the hypothesis that the scene an observer perceives is the probable source of the proximal stimulus. There is, however,  a nontrivial latency (on the order of 100 ms) between the time of a proximal stimulus and the time a visual percept is elicited. It seems plausible that it would be advantageous for an observer to have, at any time t, a percept representative of what is out there at that very time t, not a percept of the recent past. If this is so, it implies a modification to the implicit hypothesis underlying most existing probabilistic approaches to perception: the new hypothesis is that, given the proximal stimulus, the scene an observer perceives is the probable scene present at the time of the percept. That is, the hypothesis is that what an observer perceives is not the probable source of the proximal stimulus, but the probable way the probable source will be when the percept actually occurs. A model of an observer's typical movements in the world is developed, and it is shown that projected angles are perceived in a way consistent with the way the probable source will project to the eye after a small time period of forward movement by the observer. The predicted and actual direction of projected-angle misperception is sometimes toward 90{\o} and sometimes away from 90{\o}, depending on whether the probable source angle is lying in a plane parallel or perpendicular to the probable direction of motion, respectively. The perception of angular size for lines in a figure with cues they are lying in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion is also shown to fit the predictions of the model.},

	Abstract = {
                The diffusion model is a commonly used tool to infer latent psychological processes underlying decision-making, and to link them to neural mechanisms based on response times. Although efficient open source software has been made available to quantitatively fit the model to data, current estimation methods require an abundance of response time measurements to recover meaningful parameters, and only provide point estimates of each parameter. In contrast, hierarchical Bayesian parameter estimation methods are useful for enhancing statistical power, allowing for simultaneous estimation of individual subject parameters and the group distribution that they are drawn from, while also providing measures of uncertainty in these parameters in the posterior distribution. Here, we present a novel Python-based toolbox called {HDDM} (hierarchical drift diffusion model), which allows fast and flexible estimation of the the drift-diffusion model and the related linear ballistic accumulator model. {HDDM} requires fewer data per subject/condition than non-hierarchical methods, allows for full Bayesian data analysis, and can handle outliers in the data. Finally, {HDDM} supports the estimation of how trial-by-trial measurements (e.g., {fMRI}) influence decision-making parameters. This paper will first describe the theoretical background of the drift diffusion model and Bayesian inference. We then illustrate usage of the toolbox on a real-world data set from our lab. Finally, parameter recovery studies show that {HDDM} beats alternative fitting methods like the χ(2)-quantile method as well as maximum likelihood estimation.

	Abstract = {In complex networks such as gene networks, traffic systems or brain circuits it is important to understand how long it takes for the different parts of the network to effectively influence one another. In the brain, for example, axonal delays between brain areas can amount to several tens of milliseconds, adding an intrinsic component to any timing-based processing of information. Inferring neural interaction delays is thus needed to interpret the information transfer revealed by any analysis of directed interactions across brain structures. However, a robust estimation of interaction delays from neural activity faces several challenges if modeling assumptions on interaction mechanisms are wrong or cannot be made. Here, we propose a robust estimator for neuronal interaction delays rooted in an information-theoretic framework, which allows a model-free exploration of interactions. In particular, we extend transfer entropy to account for delayed source-target interactions, while crucially retaining the conditioning on the embedded target state at the immediately previous time step. We prove that this particular extension is indeed guaranteed to identify interaction delays between two coupled systems and is the only relevant option in keeping with Wiener's principle of causality. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in detecting interaction delays on finite data by numerical simulations of stochastic and deterministic processes, as well as on local field potential recordings. We also show the ability of the extended transfer entropy to detect the presence of multiple delays, as well as feedback loops. While evaluated on neuroscience data, we expect the estimator to be useful in other fields dealing with network dynamics.},

	Abstract = {(This chapter is reprints material from {Zamarre\~{n}o-Ramos} et al. in Front. Neurosci. 5:26, 2011 and {Serrano-Gotarredona} et al. in Front. Neurosci. 7:02, 2013, with permission.) Here we present a very exciting overlap between emergent nano technology and neuroscience, which has been discovered by neuromorphic engineers. Specifically, we are linking one type of memristor nano technology devices to the biological synaptic update rule known as {Spike-Time}-{Dependent-Plasticity} found in real biological synapses. Understanding this link allows neuromorphic engineers to develop circuit architectures that use this type of memristors to artificially emulate parts of the visual cortex. We focus on the type of memristors referred to as voltage or flux driven memristors and focus our discussions on behavioral macro models for such devices. The implementations result in fully asynchronous architectures with neurons sending their action potentials not only forwards but also backwards. One critical aspect is to use neurons that generate spikes of specific shapes. We will see how by changing the shapes of the neuron action potential spikes we can tune and manipulate the {STDP} learning rules for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We will see how neurons and memristors can be interconnected to achieve large scale spiking learning systems, that follow a type of multiplicative {STDP} learning rule. We will briefly extend the architectures to use three-terminal transistors with similar memristive behavior. We will illustrate how a V1 visual cortex layer can be assembled and how it is capable of learning to extract orientations from visual data coming from a real artificial {CMOS} spiking retina observing real life scenes. Finally, we will discuss limitations of currently available memristors. The results presented are based on behavioral simulations and do not take into account non-idealities of devices and interconnects. The aim here is to present, in a tutorial manner, an initial framework for the possible development of fully asynchronous {STDP} learning neuromorphic architectures exploiting two or three terminal memristive type devices.

	Abstract = {Motion parallax is a motion-based, monocular depth cue that uses an object's relative motion and velocity as a cue to relative depth. In adults, and in monkeys, a smooth pursuit eye movement signal is used to disambiguate the depth-sign provided by these relative motion cues. The current study investigates infants' perception of depth from motion parallax and the development of two oculomotor functions, smooth pursuit and the ocular following response ({OFR}) eye movements. Infants 8 to 20 weeks of age were presented with three tasks in a single session: depth from motion parallax, smooth pursuit tracking, and {OFR} to translation. The development of smooth pursuit was significantly related to age, as was sensitivity to motion parallax. {OFR} eye movements also corresponded to both age and smooth pursuit gain, with groups of infants demonstrating asymmetric function in both types of eye movements. These results suggest that the development of the eye movement system may play a crucial role in the sensitivity to depth from motion parallax in infancy. Moreover, describing the development of these oculomotor functions in relation to depth perception may aid in the understanding of certain visual dysfunctions.},

	Abstract = {Development of orientation maps in ferret and cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to be stable, in that the earliest measurable maps are similar in form to the eventual adult map, robust, in that similar maps develop in both dark rearing and in a variety of normal visual environments, and yet adaptive, in that the final map pattern reflects the statistics of the specific visual environment. How can these three properties be reconciled? Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results. Specifically, contrast-gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},

In particular, the role of the embodiment for the behavior of both artificial and natural beings has become of much and increasing interest in recent times. In robotics, there are essentially two attitudes towards the physical embodiment. On the one hand, with rule based systems and/or systems intended to execute a given motion plan, embodiment is more or less considered as a (nasty) problem opposing the execution of the plan. On the other hand, it is well believed and verified by many examples that living beings are taking much advantage from the physico-mechanical properties of their bodies in order to create natural motion patterns.},

@article{Antolik13,
	Abstract = {The increasing availability of computational resources is enabling more detailed, realistic modeling in computational neuroscience, resulting in a shift toward more heterogeneous models of neuronal circuits, and employment of complex experimental protocols. This poses a challenge for existing tool chains, as the set of tools involved in a typical modeler's workflow is expanding concomitantly, with growing complexity in the metadata flowing between them. For many parts of the workflow, a range of tools is available; however, numerous areas lack dedicated tools, while integration of existing tools is limited. This forces modelers to either handle the workflow manually, leading to errors, or to write substantial amounts of code to automate parts of the workflow, in both cases reducing their productivity. To address these issues, we have developed Mozaik: a workflow system for spiking neuronal network simulations written in Python. Mozaik integrates model, experiment and stimulation specification, simulation execution, data storage, data analysis and visualization into a single automated workflow, ensuring that all relevant metadata are available to all workflow components. It is based on several existing tools, including {PyNN}, Neo, and Matplotlib. It offers a declarative way to specify models and recording configurations using hierarchically organized configuration files. Mozaik automatically records all data together with all relevant metadata about the experimental context, allowing automation of the analysis and visualization stages. Mozaik has a modular architecture, and the existing modules are designed to be extensible with minimal programming effort. Mozaik increases the productivity of running virtual experiments on highly structured neuronal networks by automating the entire experimental cycle, while increasing the reliability of modeling studies by relieving the user from manual handling of the flow of metadata between the individual workflow stages.},

	Abstract = {A declarative extensible markup language ({SpineML}) for describing the dynamics, network and experiments of large-scale spiking neural network simulations is described which builds upon the {NineML} standard. It utilises a level of abstraction which targets point neuron representation but addresses the limitations of existing tools by allowing arbitrary dynamics to be expressed. The use of {XML} promotes model sharing, is human readable and allows collaborative working. The syntax uses a high-level self explanatory format which allows straight forward code generation or translation of a model description to a native simulator format. This paper demonstrates the use of code generation in order to translate, simulate and reproduce the results of a benchmark model across a range of simulators. The flexibility of the {SpineML} syntax is highlighted by reproducing a pre-existing, biologically constrained model of a neural microcircuit (the striatum). The {SpineML} code is open source and is available at {http://bimpa.group.shef.ac.uk/SpineML}.},

	Abstract = {Likelihood-based encoding models founded on point processes have received significant attention in the literature because of their ability to reveal the information encoded by spiking neural populations. We propose an approximation to the likelihood of a point-process model of neurons that holds under assumptions about the continuous time process that are physiologically reasonable for neural spike trains: the presence of a refractory period, the predictability of the conditional intensity function, and its integrability. These are properties that apply to a large class of point processes arising in applications other than neuroscience. The proposed approach has several advantages over conventional ones. In particular, one can use standard fitting procedures for generalized linear models based on iteratively reweighted least squares while improving the accuracy of the approximation to the likelihood and reducing bias in the estimation of the parameters of the underlying continuous-time model. As a result, the proposed approach can use a larger bin size to achieve the same accuracy as conventional approaches would with a smaller bin size. This is particularly important when analyzing neural data with high mean and instantaneous firing rates. We demonstrate these claims on simulated and real neural spiking activity. By allowing a substantive increase in the required bin size, our algorithm has the potential to lower the barrier to the use of point-process methods in an increasing number of applications.},

	Abstract = {The role intrinsic statistical fluctuations play in creating avalanches -- patterns of complex bursting activity with scale-free properties -- is examined in leaky Markovian networks. Using this broad class of models, we develop a probabilistic approach that employs a potential energy landscape perspective coupled with a macroscopic description based on statistical thermodynamics. We identify six important thermodynamic quantities essential for characterizing system behavior as a function of network size: the internal potential energy, entropy, free potential energy, internal pressure, pressure, and bulk modulus. In agreement with classical phase transitions, these quantities evolve smoothly as a function of the network size until a critical value is reached. At that value, a discontinuity in pressure is observed that leads to a spike in the bulk modulus demarcating loss of thermodynamic robustness. We attribute this novel result to a reallocation of the ground states (global minima) of the system's stationary potential energy landscape caused by a noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface. Further analysis demonstrates that appreciable levels of intrinsic noise can cause avalanching, a complex mode of operation that dominates system dynamics at near-critical or subcritical network sizes. Illustrative examples are provided using an epidemiological model of bacterial infection, where avalanching has not been characterized before, and a previously studied model of computational neuroscience, where avalanching was erroneously attributed to specific neural architectures. The general methods developed here can be used to study the emergence of avalanching (and other complex phenomena) in many biological, physical and man-made interaction networks. Networks of noisy interacting components arise in diverse scientific disciplines. Here, we develop a mathematical framework to study the underlying causes of a bursting phenomenon in network activity known as avalanching. As prototypical examples, we study a model of disease spreading in a population of individuals and a model of brain activity in a neural network. Although avalanching is well-documented in neural networks, thought to be crucial for learning, information processing, and memory, it has not been studied before in disease spreading. We employ tools originally used to analyze thermodynamic systems to argue that randomness in the actions of individual network components plays a fundamental role in avalanche formation. We show that avalanching is a spontaneous behavior, brought about by a phenomenon reminiscent to a phase transition in statistical mechanics, caused by increasing randomness as the network size decreases. Our work demonstrates that a previously suggested balanced feed-forward network structure is not necessary for neuronal avalanching. Instead, we attribute avalanching to a reallocation of the global minima of the network's stationary potential energy landscape, caused by a noise-induced deformation of its topographic surface.},

	Abstract = {The complex connectivity of the cerebral cortex suggests that inter-regional communication is a primary function. Using computational modeling, we show that anatomical connectivity may be a major determinant for global information flow in brain networks. A macaque brain network was implemented as a communication network in which signal units flowed between grey matter nodes along white matter paths. Compared to degree-matched surrogate networks, information flow on the macaque brain network was characterized by higher loss rates, faster transit times and lower throughput, suggesting that neural connectivity may be optimized for speed rather than fidelity. Much of global communication was mediated by a  '' rich club'' of hub regions: a sub-graph comprised of high-degree nodes that are more densely interconnected with each other than predicted by chance. First, macaque communication patterns most closely resembled those observed for a synthetic rich club network, but were less similar to those seen in a synthetic small world network, suggesting that the former is a more fundamental feature of brain network topology. Second, rich club regions attracted the most signal traffic and likewise, connections between rich club regions carried more traffic than connections between non-rich club regions. Third, a number of rich club regions were significantly under-congested, suggesting that macaque connectivity actively shapes information flow, funneling traffic towards some nodes and away from others. Together, our results indicate a critical role of the rich club of hub nodes in dynamic aspects of global brain communication. A fundamental question in systems neuroscience is how the structural connectivity of the cerebral cortex shapes global communication. Here, using computational modeling in conjunction with an anatomically realistic structural network, we show that cortico-cortical communication is constrained by high-level features of brain network topology. We find that neural network topology is configured in a way that prioritizes speed of information flow over reliability and total throughput. The defining characteristic of the information processing architecture of the network is a densely interconnected rich club of hub nodes. Namely, rich club nodes and connections between rich club nodes absorb the greatest proportion of total signal traffic. In addition, rich club connectivity appears to actively shape information flow, whereby signal traffic is biased towards some nodes and away from others. Finally, synthetic networks containing a rich club could almost perfectly reproduce the information flow patterns of the real anatomical network. Altogether, our data demonstrate that a central collective of highly interconnected hubs serves to facilitate cortico-cortical communication. By simulating communication on a static structural network we have revealed a dynamic aspect of the global information processing architecture and the critical role played by the rich club of hub nodes.},

@article{Kelly14,
	Abstract = {In a wide range of studies, the emergence of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex has been attributed to a complex interaction between feed-forward thalamic input and inhibitory mechanisms at the level of cortex. Although it is well known that layer 4 cortical neurons are highly sensitive to the timing of thalamic inputs, the role of the stimulus-driven timing of thalamic inputs in cortical orientation selectivity is not well understood. Here we show that the synchronization of thalamic firing contributes directly to the orientation tuned responses of primary visual cortex in a way that optimizes the stimulus information per cortical spike. From the recorded responses of geniculate X-cells in the anesthetized cat, we synthesized thalamic sub-populations that would likely serve as the synaptic input to a common layer 4 cortical neuron based on anatomical constraints. We used this synchronized input as the driving input to an integrate-and-fire model of cortical responses and demonstrated that the tuning properties match closely to those measured in primary visual cortex. By modulating the overall level of synchronization at the preferred orientation, we show that efficiency of information transmission in the cortex is maximized for levels of synchronization which match those reported in thalamic recordings in response to naturalistic stimuli, a property which is relatively invariant to the orientation tuning width. These findings indicate evidence for a more prominent role of the feed-forward thalamic input in cortical feature selectivity based on thalamic synchronization. While the visual system is selective for a wide range of different inputs, orientation selectivity has been considered the preeminent property of the mammalian visual cortex. Existing models of this selectivity rely on varying relative importance of feedforward thalamic input and intracortical influence. Recently, we have shown that pairwise timing relationships between single thalamic neurons can be predictive of a high degree of orientation selectivity. Here we have constructed a computational model that predicts cortical orientation tuning from thalamic populations. We show that this arrangement, relying on precise timing differences between thalamic responses, accurately predicts tuning properties as well as demonstrates that certain timing relationships are optimal for transmitting information about the stimulus to cortex.},

	Abstract = {Previous work has demonstrated that the human visual system can detect animals in complex natural scenes very efficiently and rapidly. In particular, using a saccadic choice task, H. Kirchner and S. J. Thorpe () found that when two images are simultaneously flashed in the left and right visual fields, saccades toward the side with an animal can be initiated in as little as 120--130 ms. Here we show that saccades toward human faces are even faster, with the earliest reliable saccades occurring in just 100--110 ms, and mean reaction times of roughly 140 ms. Intriguingly, it appears that these very fast saccades are not completely under instructional control, because when faces were paired with photographs of vehicles, fast saccades were still biased toward faces even when the subject was targeting vehicles. Finally, we tested whether these very fast saccades might only occur in the simple case where the images are presented left and right of fixation by showing they also occur when the images are presented above and below fixation. Such results impose very serious constraints on the sorts of processing model that can be invoked and demonstrate that face-selective behavioral responses can be generated extremely rapidly.},

@article{VanRullen01,
	Abstract = {Visual processing is known to be very fast in ultra-rapid categorisation tasks where the subject has to decide whether a briefly flashed image belongs to a target category or not. Human subjects can respond in under 400 ms, and event-related-potential studies have shown that the underlying processing can be done in less than 150 ms. Monkeys trained to perform the same task have proved even faster. However, most of these experiments have only been done with biologically relevant target categories such as animals or food. Here we performed the same study on human subjects, alternating between a task in which the target category was 'animal', and a task in which the target category was 'means of transport'. These natural images of clearly artificial objects contained targets as varied as cars, trucks, trains, boats, aircraft, and hot-air balloons. However, the subjects performed almost identically in both tasks, with reaction times not significantly longer in the 'means of transport' task. These reaction times were much shorter than in any previous study on natural-image processing. We conclude that, at least for these two superordinate categories, the speed of ultra-rapid visual categorisation of natural scenes does not depend on the target category, and that this processing could rely primarily on feed-forward, automatic mechanisms.},

@article{Peelen09,
	Abstract = {The visual system has an extraordinary capability to extract categorical information from complex natural scenes. For example, subjects are able to rapidly detect the presence of object categories such as animals or vehicles in new scenes that are presented very briefly. This is even true when subjects do not pay attention to the scenes and simultaneously perform an unrelated attentionally demanding task, a stark contrast to the capacity limitations predicted by most theories of visual attention. Here we show a neural basis for rapid natural scene categorization in the visual cortex, using functional magnetic resonance imaging and an object categorization task in which subjects detected the presence of people or cars in briefly presented natural scenes. The multi-voxel pattern of neural activity in the object-selective cortex evoked by the natural scenes contained information about the presence of the target category, even when the scenes were task-irrelevant and presented outside the focus of spatial attention. These findings indicate that the rapid detection of categorical information in natural scenes is mediated by a category-specific biasing mechanism in object-selective cortex that operates in parallel across the visual field, and biases information processing in favour of objects belonging to the target object category.},

This process, thought to be stimulus driven and hard wired, has substrates in primary visual cortex (V1). Here, however, we find contour integration in V1 to depend strongly on perceptual learning and top-down influences that are specific to contour detection. In naive monkeys, the information about contours embedded in complex backgrounds is absent in V1 neuronal responses and is independent of the locus of spatial attention. Training animals to find embedded contours induces strong contour-related responses specific to the trained retinotopic region. These responses are most robust when animals perform the contour detection task but disappear under anesthesia. Our findings suggest that top-down influences dynamically adapt neural circuits according to specific perceptual tasks. This may serve as a general neuronal mechanism of perceptual learning and reflect top-down mediated changes in cortical states.},

	Abstract = {The ability to derive meaning from complex sensory input requires the integration of information over space and time, as well as cognitive mechanisms to shape that integration. We studied these processes in the primary visual cortex (V1), where neurons are thought to integrate visual inputs along contours defined by an association field ({AF}). We recorded extracellularly from single cells in macaque V1 to map the {AF}, by using an optimization algorithm to find the contours that maximally activated individual cells. We combined the algorithm with a delayed-match-to-sample task, to test how the optimal contours might be molded by the monkey's expectation for particular cue shapes. We found that V1 neurons were selective for complex shapes, a property previously ascribed to higher cortical areas. Furthermore, the shape selectivity was reprogrammed by perceptual task: Over the whole network, the optimal modes of geometric selectivity shifted between distinct subsets of the {AF}, alternately representing different stimulus features known to predominate in natural scenes. Our results suggest a general model of cortical function, whereby horizontal connections provide a broad domain of potential associations, and top--down inputs dynamically gate these linkages to task switch the function of a network.},

@article{Ramalingam13,
	Abstract = {The primary visual cortex (V1) changes its computation according to the perceptual task being performed. We propose that this cognitive modulation results from gating of V1 intrinsic connections. To test this idea, using behavioral paradigms that engage top-down modulation of V1 contextual interactions, we recorded from chronically implanted electrode arrays in macaques. We observed task-dependent changes in interactions between V1 sites measured both by correlation between spike trains and by coherence between local field potentials ({LFP}-{LFP} coherence). The direction of the changes in aggregate activity, as measured by {LFPs}, depended on perceptual strategy: perceptual grouping increased {LFP} coherence between sites crucial for the task, whereas perceptual segregation lowered the {LFP} coherence. Using spiking activity as a measure, we found that the behaviorally driven changes in correlation structure between neurons dramatically increased the stimulus-related information that they convey; this additional increase in encoded information at the level of neuronal ensembles equals that obtained from task-driven reconfigurations of neural tuning curves.

Over the population, varying attentional state had no significant effect on the response to an isolated stimulus within the {RF} but had a large influence on the facilitatory effects of contextual lines. We propose that the attentional modulation of contextual effects represents a gating of long range horizontal connections within area V1 by feedback connections to V1 and that this gating provides a mechanism for shaping responses under attention to stimulus configuration.},

	Abstract = {In this chapter we present a very exciting overlap between emergent nanotechnology and neuroscience, which has been discovered by neuromorphic engineers. Specifically, we are linking one type of memristor nano technology devices to the biological synaptic update rule known as {Spike-Time}-{Dependent-Plasticity} found in real biological synapses. Understanding this link allows neuromorphic engineers to develop circuit architectures that use this type of memristors to artificially emulate parts of the visual cortex. The implementations result in fully asynchronous architectures with neurons sending their action potentials not only forwards but also backwards. One critical aspect is to use neurons that generate spikes of specific shapes. We will see how by changing the shapes of the neuron action potential spikes we can tune and manipulate the {STDP} learning rules for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. We will see how neurons and memristors can be interconnected to achieve large-scale spiking learning systems that follow an {STDP} learning rule, and how hibrid {memristor-CMOS} chips can be assembled onto scalable architectures exploiting {AER} ({Address-Event}-Representation) technology. Finally, we will discuss limitations of currently available memristors. The results presented are based on behavioral simulations and do not take into account non-idealities of devices and interconnects. Our aim here is to simply present, in a tutorial manner, an initial framework for the possible development of fully asynchronous {STDP} learning neuromorphic architectures exploiting two-terminal memristive type devices.},

@article{Nortmann13,
	Abstract = {The visual system is confronted with rapidly changing stimuli in everyday life. It is not well understood how information in such a stream of input is updated within the brain. We performed voltage-sensitive dye imaging across the primary visual cortex (V1) to capture responses to sequences of natural scene contours. We presented vertically and horizontally filtered natural images, and their superpositions, at 10 or 33 Hz. At low frequency, the encoding was found to represent not the currently presented images, but differences in orientation between consecutive images. This was in sharp contrast to more rapid sequences for which we found an ongoing representation of current input, consistent with earlier studies. Our finding that for slower image sequences, V1 does no longer report actual features but represents their relative difference in time counteracts the view that the first cortical processing stage must always transfer complete information. Instead, we show its capacities for change detection with a new emphasis on the role of automatic computation evolving in the 100-ms range, inevitably affecting information transmission further downstream.},

	Abstract = {Two people may claim both to be naturalists, but have divergent conceptions
of basic elements of the natural world which lead them to mean different things
when they talk about laws of nature, or states, or the role of mathematics in
physics. These disagreements do not much affect the ordinary practice of
science which is about small subsystems of the universe, described or explained
against a background, idealized to be fixed. But these issues become crucial
when we consider including the whole universe within our system, for then there
is no fixed background to reference observables to. I argue here that the key
issue responsible for divergent versions of naturalism and divergent approaches
to cosmology is the conception of time. One version, which I call temporal
naturalism, holds that time, in the sense of the succession of present moments,
is real, and that laws of nature evolve in that time. This is contrasted with
timeless naturalism, which holds that laws are immutable and the present moment
and its passage are illusions. I argue that temporal naturalism is empirically
more adequate than the alternatives, because it offers testable explanations
for puzzles its rivals cannot address, and is likely a better basis for solving
major puzzles that presently face cosmology and physics.


This essay also addresses the problem of qualia and experience within
naturalism and argues that only temporal naturalism can make a place for qualia
as intrinsic qualities of matter.},

@article{Penny13,
	Abstract = {
                This paper shows that the various computations underlying spatial cognition can be implemented using statistical inference in a single probabilistic model. Inference is implemented using a common set of 'lower-level' computations involving forward and backward inference over time. For example, to estimate where you are in a known environment, forward inference is used to optimally combine location estimates from path integration with those from sensory input. To decide which way to turn to reach a goal, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of reaching that goal under each option. To work out which environment you are in, forward inference is used to compute the likelihood of sensory observations under the different hypotheses. For reaching sensory goals that require a chaining together of decisions, forward inference can be used to compute a state trajectory that will lead to that goal, and backward inference to refine the route and estimate control signals that produce the required trajectory. We propose that these computations are reflected in recent findings of pattern replay in the mammalian brain. Specifically, that theta sequences reflect decision making, theta flickering reflects model selection, and remote replay reflects route and motor planning. We also propose a mapping of the above computational processes onto lateral and medial entorhinal cortex and hippocampus.

@article{Behuret13,
	Abstract = {The thalamus is the primary gateway that relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex. While a single recipient cortical cell receives the convergence of many principal relay cells of the thalamus, each thalamic cell in turn integrates a dense and distributed synaptic feedback from the cortex. During sensory processing, the influence of this functional loop remains largely ignored. Using dynamic-clamp techniques in thalamic slices in vitro, we combined theoretical and experimental approaches to implement a realistic hybrid retino-thalamo-cortical pathway mixing biological cells and simulated circuits. The synaptic bombardment of cortical origin was mimicked through the injection of a stochastic mixture of excitatory and inhibitory conductances, resulting in a gradable correlation level of afferent activity shared by thalamic cells. The study of the impact of the simulated cortical input on the global retinocortical signal transfer efficiency revealed a novel control mechanism resulting from the collective resonance of all thalamic relay neurons. We show here that the transfer efficiency of sensory input transmission depends on three key features: i) the number of thalamocortical cells involved in the many-to-one convergence from thalamus to cortex, ii) the statistics of the corticothalamic synaptic bombardment and iii) the level of correlation imposed between converging thalamic relay cells. In particular, our results demonstrate counterintuitively that the retinocortical signal transfer efficiency increases when the level of correlation across thalamic cells decreases. This suggests that the transfer efficiency of relay cells could be selectively amplified when they become simultaneously desynchronized by the cortical feedback. When applied to the intact brain, this network regulation mechanism could direct an attentional focus to specific thalamic subassemblies and select the appropriate input lines to the cortex according to the descending influence of cortically-defined  '' priors''. Most of the sensory information in the early visual system is relayed from the retina to the primary visual cortex through principal relay cells in the thalamus. While relay cells receive \~{}7--16\% of their synapses from retina, they integrate the synaptic barrage of a dense cortical feedback, which accounts for more than 60\% of their total input. This feedback is thought to carry some form of  '' prior'' resulting from the computation performed in cortical areas, which influences the response of relay cells, presumably by regulating the transfer of sensory information to cortical areas. Nevertheless, its statistical nature (input synchronization, excitation/inhibition ratio, etc.) and the cellular mechanisms gating thalamic transfer are largely ignored. Here we implemented hybrid circuits (biological and modeled cells) reproducing the main features of the thalamic gate and explored the functional impact of various statistics of the cortical input. We found that the regulation of sensory information is critically determined by the statistical coherence of the cortical synaptic bombardment associated with a stochastic facilitation process. We propose that this tuning mechanism could operate in the intact brain to selectively filter the sensory information reaching cortical areas according to attended features predesignated by the cortical feedback.},

	Abstract = {For every engineer it goes without saying: in order to build a reliable system we need components that consistently behave precisely as they should. It is also well known that neurons, the building blocks of brains, do not satisfy this constraint. Even neurons of the same type come with huge variances in their properties and these properties also vary over time. Synapses, the connections between neurons, are highly unreliable in forwarding signals. In this paper we argue that both these fact add variance to neuronal processes, and that this variance is not a handicap of neural systems, but that instead predictable and reliable functional behavior of neural systems depends crucially on this variability. In particular, we show that higher variance allows a recurrently connected neural population to react more sensitively to incoming signals, and processes them faster and more energy efficient. This, for example, challenges the general assumption that the intrinsic variability of neurons in the brain is a defect that has to be overcome by synaptic plasticity in the process of learning.},

	Abstract = {Why are we scared by nonperceptual entities such as the bogeyman, and why does the bogeyman only visit us during the night? Why does hearing a window squeaking in the night suggest to us the unlikely idea of a thief or a killer? And why is this more likely to happen after watching a horror movie? To answer these and similar questions, we need to put mind and body together again and consider the embodied nature of perceptual and cognitive inference. Predictive coding provides a general framework for perceptual inference; I propose to extend it by including interoceptive and bodily information. The resulting embodied predictive coding inference permits one to compare alternative hypotheses (e.g., is the sound I hear generated by a thief or the wind?) using the same inferential scheme as in predictive coding, but using both sensory and interoceptive information as evidence, rather than just considering sensory events. If you hear a window squeaking in the night after watching a horror movie, you may consider plausible a very unlikely hypothesis (e.g., a thief, or even the bogeyman) because it explains both what you sense (e.g., the window squeaking in the night) and how you feel (e.g., your high heart rate). The good news is that the inference that I propose is fully rational and gives minds and bodies equal dignity. The bad news is that it also gives an embodiment to the bogeyman, and a reason to fear it.},

	Abstract = {Representing signals as linear combinations of basis vectors sparsely selected from an overcomplete dictionary has proven to be advantageous for many applications in pattern recognition, machine learning, signal processing, and computer vision. While this approach was originally inspired by insights into cortical information processing, biologically plausible approaches have been limited to exploring the functionality of early sensory processing in the brain, while more practical applications have employed non-biologically plausible sparse coding algorithms. Here, a biologically plausible algorithm is proposed that can be applied to practical problems. This algorithm is evaluated using standard benchmark tasks in the domain of pattern classification, and its performance is compared to a wide range of alternative algorithms that are widely used in signal and image processing. The results show that for the classification tasks performed here, the proposed method is competitive with the best of the alternative algorithms that have been evaluated. This demonstrates that classification using sparse representations can be performed in a neurally plausible manner, and hence, that this mechanism of classification might be exploited by the brain.},

	Abstract = {Traveling waves of neuronal oscillations have been observed in many cortical regions, including the motor and sensory cortex. Such waves are often modulated in a task-dependent fashion although their precise functional role remains a matter of debate. Here we conjecture that the cortex can utilize the direction and wavelength of traveling waves to encode information. We present a novel neural mechanism by which such information may be decoded by the spatial arrangement of receptors within the dendritic receptor field. In particular, we show how the density distributions of excitatory and inhibitory receptors can combine to act as a spatial filter of wave patterns. The proposed dendritic mechanism ensures that the neuron selectively responds to specific wave patterns, thus constituting a neural basis of pattern decoding. We validate this proposal in the descending motor system, where we model the large receptor fields of the pyramidal tract neurons --- the principle outputs of the motor cortex --- decoding motor commands encoded in the direction of traveling wave patterns in motor cortex. We use an existing model of field oscillations in motor cortex to investigate how the topology of the pyramidal cell receptor field acts to tune the cells responses to specific oscillatory wave patterns, even when those patterns are highly degraded. The model replicates key findings of the descending motor system during simple motor tasks, including variable interspike intervals and weak corticospinal coherence. By additionally showing how the nature of the wave patterns can be controlled by modulating the topology of local intra-cortical connections, we hence propose a novel integrated neuronal model of encoding and decoding motor commands. Physiological studies in humans and monkeys have revealed spatially organized waves of neuronal activity that propagate across the cortex during sensory or behavioral tasks. However the functional role of such waves remains elusive. In the present study, we use numerical simulation to investigate whether wave patterns may serve as a basis for neural coding in cortex. Specifically, we propose a theoretical dendritic mechanism which permits neurons to respond selectively to the morphological properties of waves. In this proposal, the arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory receptors within the dendritic receptor field constitutes a spatial filter of the incoming wave patterns. The proposed mechanism allows the neuron to discriminate waves based on wavelength and orientation, thereby providing a basis for neural decoding. We explore this concept in the context of the descending motor system where the pyramidal tract neurons of motor cortex monosynaptically innervate motor neurons in the spinal cord. Pyramidal tract neurons have broad dendritic fields which make them ideal candidates for spatial filters of waves in motor cortex. Our model demonstrates how wave patterns in motor cortex can be transformed into a descending motor drive which replicates some fundamental oscillatory properties of human motor physiology.},

	Abstract = {The mismatch negativity ({MMN}) is an event related potential evoked by violations of regularity. Here, we present a model of the underlying neuronal dynamics based upon the idea that auditory cortex continuously updates a generative model to predict its sensory inputs. The {MMN} is then modelled as the superposition of the electric fields evoked by neuronal activity reporting prediction errors. The process by which auditory cortex generates predictions and resolves prediction errors was simulated using generalised (Bayesian) filtering -- a biologically plausible scheme for probabilistic inference on the hidden states of hierarchical dynamical models. The resulting scheme generates realistic {MMN} waveforms, explains the qualitative effects of deviant probability and magnitude on the {MMN} -- in terms of latency and amplitude -- and makes quantitative predictions about the interactions between deviant probability and magnitude. This work advances a formal understanding of the {MMN} and -- more generally -- illustrates the potential for developing computationally informed dynamic causal models of empirical electromagnetic responses. Computational neuroimaging enables quantitative inferences from non-invasive measures of brain activity on the underlying mechanisms. Ultimately, we would like to understand these mechanisms not only in terms of physiology but also in terms of computation. So far, this has not been addressed by mathematical models of neuroimaging data (e.g., dynamic causal models), which have rather focused on ever more detailed inferences about physiology. Here we present the first instance of a dynamic causal model that explains electrophysiological data in terms of computation rather than physiology. Concretely, we predict the mismatch negativity -- an event-related potential elicited by regularity violation -- from the dynamics of perceptual inference as prescribed by the free energy principle. The resulting model explains the waveform of the mismatch negativity and some of its phenomenological properties at a level of precision that has not been attempted before. This highlights the potential of neurocomputational dynamic causal models to enable inferences from neuroimaging data on neurocomputational mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Mouse visual cortex is subdivided into multiple distinct, hierarchically organized areas that are interconnected through feedforward ({FF}) and feedback ({FB}) pathways. The principal synaptic targets of {FF} and {FB} axons that reciprocally interconnect primary visual cortex (V1) with the higher lateromedial extrastriate area ({LM}) are pyramidal cells (Pyr) and parvalbumin ({PV})-expressing {GABAergic} interneurons. Recordings in slices of mouse visual cortex have shown that layer 2/3 Pyr cells receive excitatory monosynaptic {FF} and {FB} inputs, which are opposed by disynaptic inhibition. Most notably, inhibition is stronger in the {FF} than {FB} pathway, suggesting pathway-specific organization of feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). To explore the hypothesis that this difference is due to diverse pathway-specific strengths of the inputs to {PV} neurons we have performed subcellular Channelrhodopsin-2-assisted circuit mapping in slices of mouse visual cortex. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were obtained from retrobead-labeled {FFV1}→{LM}- and {FBLM}→V1-projecting Pyr cells, as well as from {tdTomato}-expressing {PV} neurons. The results show that the {FFV1}→{LM} pathway provides on average 3.7-fold stronger depolarizing input to layer 2/3 inhibitory {PV} neurons than to neighboring excitatory Pyr cells. In the {FBLM}→V1 pathway, depolarizing inputs to layer 2/3 {PV} neurons and Pyr cells were balanced. Balanced inputs were also found in the {FFV1}→{LM} pathway to layer 5 {PV} neurons and Pyr cells, whereas {FBLM}→V1 inputs to layer 5 were biased toward Pyr cells. The findings indicate that {FFI} in {FFV1}→{LM} and {FBLM}→V1 circuits are organized in a pathway- and lamina-specific fashion.},

	Abstract = {The brain makes use of noisy sensory inputs to produce eye, head, or arm motion. In most instances, the brain combines this sensory information with predictions about future events. Here, we propose that Kalman filtering can account for the dynamics of both visually guided and predictive motor behaviors within one simple unifying mechanism. Our model relies on two Kalman filters: (1) one processing visual information about retinal input; and (2) one maintaining a dynamic internal memory of target motion. The outputs of both Kalman filters are then combined in a statistically optimal manner, i.e., weighted with respect to their reliability. The model was tested on data from several smooth pursuit experiments and reproduced all major characteristics of visually guided and predictive smooth pursuit. This contrasts with the common belief that anticipatory pursuit, pursuit maintenance during target blanking, and zero-lag pursuit of sinusoidally moving targets all result from different control systems. This is the first instance of a model integrating all aspects of pursuit dynamics within one coherent and simple model and without switching between different parallel mechanisms. Our model suggests that the brain circuitry generating a pursuit command might be simpler than previously believed and only implement the functional equivalents of two Kalman filters whose outputs are optimally combined. It provides a general framework of how the brain can combine continuous sensory information with a dynamic internal memory and transform it into motor commands.},

	Abstract = {Adaptation is at the heart of sensation and nowhere is it more salient than in early visual processing. Light adaptation in photoreceptors is doubly dynamical: it depends upon the temporal structure of the input and it affects the temporal structure of the response. We introduce a non-linear dynamical adaptation model of photoreceptors. It is simple enough that it can be solved exactly and simulated with ease; analytical and numerical approaches combined provide both intuition on the behavior of dynamical adaptation and quantitative results to be compared with data. Yet the model is rich enough to capture intricate phenomenology. First, we show that it reproduces the known phenomenology of light response and short-term adaptation. Second, we present new recordings and demonstrate that the model reproduces cone response with great precision. Third, we derive a number of predictions on the response of photoreceptors to sophisticated stimuli such as periodic inputs, various forms of flickering inputs, and natural inputs. In particular, we demonstrate that photoreceptors undergo rapid adaptation of response gain and time scale, over \~{} 300 ms---i. e., over the time scale of the response itself---and we confirm this prediction with data. For natural inputs, this fast adaptation can modulate the response gain more than tenfold and is hence physiologically relevant. Photoreceptors constitute the interface between the visual world and the cerebral world, as they convert light inputs into neural signals. This conversion is subject to continuous adaptation: response gain and time scale vary as a function of input history. This adaptation is 'dynamical' both because it depends upon the temporal structure of the stimulus and because it affects the kinetics of the response. Traditionally, theoretical studies of photoreceptors fall within one of two extreme approaches: either detailed modeling based upon the biophysics of phototransduction or functional modeling based upon phenomenological descriptions of photoreceptor response. While the former approach involves too many coupled equations and unknown parameters to allow for analytical treatments, building intuition, or predicting trends, instances of the latter approach, such as the simple linear-nonlinear model, fail to capture essential features of dynamical adaptation. Here, we develop understanding at an intermediate level. We define and discuss a phenomenological model which is simple enough to allow for full solutions and predictions, but embodies features of phototransduction well enough to capture a rich phenomenology. We demonstrate that our model reproduces data with high accuracy and can be used to make predictions on the response to sophisticated visual inputs such as natural stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Two observations about the cortex have puzzled neuroscientists for a long time. First, neural responses are highly variable. Second, the level of excitation and inhibition received by each neuron is tightly balanced at all times. Here, we demonstrate that both properties are necessary consequences of neural networks that represent information efficiently in their spikes. We illustrate this insight with spiking networks that represent dynamical variables. Our approach is based on two assumptions: We assume that information about dynamical variables can be read out linearly from neural spike trains, and we assume that neurons only fire a spike if that improves the representation of the dynamical variables. Based on these assumptions, we derive a network of leaky integrate-and-fire neurons that is able to implement arbitrary linear dynamical systems. We show that the membrane voltage of the neurons is equivalent to a prediction error about a common population-level signal. Among other things, our approach allows us to construct an integrator network of spiking neurons that is robust against many perturbations. Most importantly, neural variability in our networks cannot be equated to noise. Despite exhibiting the same single unit properties as widely used population code models (e.g. tuning curves, Poisson distributed spike trains), balanced networks are orders of magnitudes more reliable. Our approach suggests that spikes do matter when considering how the brain computes, and that the reliability of cortical representations could have been strongly underestimated. Two observations about the cortex have puzzled and fascinated neuroscientists for a long time. First, neural responses are highly variable. Second, the level of excitation and inhibition received by each neuron is tightly balanced at all times. Here, we demonstrate that both properties are necessary consequences of neural networks representing information reliably and with a small number of spikes. To achieve such efficiency, spikes of individual neurons must communicate prediction errors about a common population-level signal, automatically resulting in balanced excitation and inhibition and highly variable neural responses. We illustrate our approach by focusing on the implementation of linear dynamical systems. Among other things, this allows us to construct a network of spiking neurons that can integrate input signals, yet is robust against many perturbations.

	Abstract = {Experimental data from neuroscience suggest that a substantial amount of knowledge is stored in the brain in the form of probability distributions over network states and trajectories of network states. We provide a theoretical foundation for this hypothesis by showing that even very detailed models for cortical microcircuits, with data-based diverse nonlinear neurons and synapses, have a stationary distribution of network states and trajectories of network states to which they converge exponentially fast from any initial state. We demonstrate that this convergence holds in spite of the non-reversibility of the stochastic dynamics of cortical microcircuits. We further show that, in the presence of background network oscillations, separate stationary distributions emerge for different phases of the oscillation, in accordance with experimentally reported phase-specific codes. We complement these theoretical results by computer simulations that investigate resulting computation times for typical probabilistic inference tasks on these internally stored distributions, such as marginalization or marginal maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Furthermore, we show that the inherent stochastic dynamics of generic cortical microcircuits enables them to quickly generate approximate solutions to difficult constraint satisfaction problems, where stored knowledge and current inputs jointly constrain possible solutions. This provides a powerful new computing paradigm for networks of spiking neurons, that also throws new light on how networks of neurons in the brain could carry out complex computational tasks such as prediction, imagination, memory recall and problem solving. The brain has not only the capability to process sensory input, but it can also produce predictions, imaginations, and solve problems that combine learned knowledge with information about a new scenario. But although these more complex information processing capabilities lie at the heart of human intelligence, we still do not know how they are organized and implemented in the brain. Numerous studies in cognitive science and neuroscience conclude that many of these processes involve probabilistic inference. This suggests that neuronal circuits in the brain process information in the form of probability distributions, but we are missing insight into how complex distributions could be represented and stored in large and diverse networks of neurons in the brain. We prove in this article that realistic cortical microcircuit models can store complex probabilistic knowledge by embodying probability distributions in their inherent stochastic dynamics -- yielding a knowledge representation in which typical probabilistic inference problems such as marginalization become straightforward readout tasks. We show that in cortical microcircuit models such computations can be performed satisfactorily within a few . Furthermore, we demonstrate how internally stored distributions can be programmed in a simple manner to endow a neural circuit with powerful problem solving capabilities.},

To keep activity at healthy, low levels, plasticity must therefore incorporate homeostatic control mechanisms. We find in numerical simulations of recurrent networks with a realistic triplet-based spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule (triplet {STDP}) that homeostasis has to detect rate changes on a timescale of seconds to minutes to keep the activity stable. We confirm this result in a generic mean-field formulation of network activity and homeostatic plasticity. Our results strongly suggest the existence of a homeostatic regulatory mechanism that reacts to firing rate changes on the order of seconds to minutes.

@article{Rullen98,
	Abstract = {
                The speed with which neurones in the monkey temporal lobe can respond selectively to the presence of a face implies that processing may be possible using only one spike per neurone, a finding that is problematic for conventional rate coding models that need at least two spikes to estimate interspike interval. One way of avoiding this problem uses the fact that integrate-and-fire neurones will tend to fire at different times, with the most strongly activated neurones firing first (Thorpe, 1990, Parallel Processing in Neural Systems). Under such conditions, processing can be performed by using the order in which cells in a particular layer fire as a code. To test this idea, we have explored a range of architectures using {SpikeNET} (Thorpe and Gautrais, 1997, Neural Information Processing Systems, 9), a simulator designed for modelling large populations of integrate-and-fire neurones. One such network used a simple four-layer feed-forward architecture to detect and localise the presence of human faces in natural images. Performance of the model was tested with a large range of grey-scale images of faces and other objects and was found to be remarkably good by comparison with more classic image processing techniques. The most remarkable feature of these results is that they were obtained using a purely feed-forward neural network in which none of the neurones fired more than one spike (thus ruling out conventional rate coding mechanisms). It thus appears that the combination of asynchronous spike propagation and rank order coding may provide an important key to understanding how the nervous system can achieve such a huge amount of processing in so little time.

Thus, it is difficult to assess the efficiency of these models to solve complex problems such as image processing. Here, we describe how this problem can be tackled using event-driven computation. Only the neurons that emit a discharge are processed and, as long as the average spike discharge rate is low, millions of neurons and billions of connections can be modeled. We describe the underlying computation and implementation of such a mechanism in {SpikeNET}, our neural network simulation package. The type of model one can build is not only biologically compliant, it is also computationally efficient as 400 000 synaptic weights can be propagated per second on a standard desktop computer. In addition, for large networks, we can set very small time steps (less than 0.01 ms) without significantly increasing the computation time. As an example, this method is applied to solve complex cognitive tasks such as face recognition in natural images.},

	Abstract = {Changes in inhibition during development are well documented, but the role of inhibition in adult learning-related plasticity is not understood. In songbirds, vocal recognition learning alters the neural representation of songs across the auditory forebrain, including the caudomedial nidopallium ({NCM}), a region analogous to mammalian secondary auditory cortices. Here, we block local inhibition with the iontophoretic application of gabazine, while simultaneously measuring song-evoked spiking activity in {NCM} of European starlings trained to recognize sets of conspecific songs. We find that local inhibition differentially suppresses the responses to learned and unfamiliar songs and enhances spike-rate differences between learned categories of songs. These learning-dependent response patterns emerge, in part, through inhibitory modulation of selectivity for song components and the masking of responses to specific acoustic features without altering spectrotemporal tuning. The results describe a novel form of inhibitory modulation of the encoding of learned categories and demonstrate that inhibition plays a central role in shaping the responses of neurons to learned, natural signals.},

	Abstract = {
                Complex visual tasks can usually be decomposed into a number of simpler subtasks. Whether such subtasks are solved serially or in parallel is subject to considerable debate. Here we investigate how subtasks are coordinated in time by recording from the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys. The animals were trained to perform both a simple and a composite task. In the simple task, they had to mentally trace a target curve while ignoring a distractor curve. Neuronal responses in the primary visual cortex to the target curve were enhanced relative to responses to the distractor curve 130 ms after stimulus appearance. In the composite task, the monkeys searched for a colored marker and traced a curve that was attached to this marker. In an initial phase of the trials, neuronal responses reflected visual search, and the response enhancement due to curve tracing now occurred after 230 ms, 100 ms later than in the simple task. We conclude that subtasks of the composite task are carried out in a structured and sequential manner that can be monitored in the primary visual cortex.

	Abstract = {Stimuli associated with high rewards evoke stronger neuronal activity than stimuli associated with lower rewards in many brain regions. It is not well understood how these reward effects influence activity in sensory cortices that represent low-level stimulus features. Here, we investigated the effects of reward information in the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We found that the reward value of a stimulus relative to the value of other stimuli is a good predictor of V1 activity. Relative value biases the competition between stimuli, just as has been shown for selective attention. The neuronal latency of this reward value effect in V1 was similar to the latency of attentional influences. Moreover, V1 neurons with a strong value effect also exhibited a strong attention effect, which implies that relative value and top--down attention engage overlapping, if not identical, neuronal selection mechanisms. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of reward value reach down to the earliest sensory processing levels of the cerebral cortex and imply that theories about the effects of reward coding and top--down attention on visual representations should be unified.},

	Abstract = {
                Our visual system segments images into objects and background. Figure-ground segregation relies on the detection of feature discontinuities that signal boundaries between the figures and the background and on a complementary region-filling process that groups together image regions with similar features. The neuronal mechanisms for these processes are not well understood and it is unknown how they depend on visual attention. We measured neuronal activity in V1 and V4 in a task where monkeys either made an eye movement to texture-defined figures or ignored them. V1 activity predicted the timing and the direction of the saccade if the figures were task relevant. We found that boundary detection is an early process that depends little on attention, whereas region filling occurs later and is facilitated by visual attention, which acts in an object-based manner. Our findings are explained by a model with local, bottom-up computations for boundary detection and feedback processing for region filling.

	Abstract = {
                Typical natural visual scenes contain many objects, which need to be segregated from each other and from the background. Present theories subdivide the processes responsible for this segregation into a pre-attentive and attentive system. The pre-attentive system segregates image regions that 'pop out' rapidly and in parallel across the visual field. In the primary visual cortex, responses to pre-attentively selected image regions are enhanced. When objects do not segregate automatically from the rest of the image, the time-consuming attentive system is recruited. Here we investigate whether attentive selection is also associated with a modulation of firing rates in area V1 of the brain in monkeys trained to perform a curve-tracing task. Neuronal responses to the various segments of a target curve were simultaneously enhanced relative to responses evoked by a distractor curve, even if the two curves crossed each other. This indicates that object-based attention is associated with a response enhancement at the earliest level of the visual cortical processing hierarchy.

	Abstract = {Predictive coding models suggest that predicted sensory signals are attenuated (silencing of prediction error). These models, though influential, are challenged by the fact that prediction sometimes seems to enhance rather than reduce sensory signals, as in the case of attentional cueing experiments. One possible explanation is that in these experiments, prediction (i.e., stimulus probability) is confounded with attention (i.e., task relevance), which is known to boost rather than reduce sensory signal. However, recent theoretical work on predictive coding inspires an alternative hypothesis and suggests that attention and prediction operate synergistically to improve the precision of perceptual inference. This model posits that attention leads to heightened weighting of sensory evidence, thereby reversing the sensory silencing by prediction. Here, we factorially manipulated attention and prediction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study and distinguished between these 2 hypotheses. Our results support a predictive coding model wherein attention reverses the sensory attenuation of predicted signals.},

	Abstract = {Brain fluctuations at rest are not random but are structured in spatial patterns of correlated activity across different brain areas. The question of how resting-state functional connectivity ({FC}) emerges from the brain's anatomical connections has motivated several experimental and computational studies to understand structure--function relationships. However, the mechanistic origin of resting state is obscured by large-scale models' complexity, and a close structure--function relation is still an open problem. Thus, a realistic but simple enough description of relevant brain dynamics is needed. Here, we derived a dynamic mean field model that consistently summarizes the realistic dynamics of a detailed spiking and conductance-based synaptic large-scale network, in which connectivity is constrained by diffusion imaging data from human subjects. The dynamic mean field approximates the ensemble dynamics, whose temporal evolution is dominated by the longest time scale of the system. With this reduction, we demonstrated that {FC} emerges as structured linear fluctuations around a stable low firing activity state close to destabilization. Moreover, the model can be further and crucially simplified into a set of motion equations for statistical moments, providing a direct analytical link between anatomical structure, neural network dynamics, and {FC}. Our study suggests that {FC} arises from noise propagation and dynamical slowing down of fluctuations in an anatomically constrained dynamical system. Altogether, the reduction from spiking models to statistical moments presented here provides a new framework to explicitly understand the building up of {FC} through neuronal dynamics underpinned by anatomical connections and to drive hypotheses in task-evoked studies and for clinical applications.},

	Abstract = {The slight perversion of the original title of this piece (The Future of the Bayesian Brain) reflects my attempt to write prospectively about 'Science and Stories' over the past 20 years. I will meet this challenge by dealing with the future and then turning to its history. The future of the Bayesian brain (in neuroimaging) is clear: it is the application of dynamic causal modeling to understand how the brain conforms to the free energy principle. In this context, the Bayesian brain is a corollary of the free energy principle, which says that any self organizing system (like a brain or neuroimaging community) must maximize the evidence for its own existence, which means it must minimize its free energy using a model of its world. Dynamic causal modeling involves finding models of the brain that have the greatest evidence or the lowest free energy. In short, the future of imaging neuroscience is to refine models of the brain to minimize free energy, where the brain refines models of the world to minimize free energy. This endeavor itself minimizes free energy because our community is itself a self organizing system. I cannot imagine an alternative future that has the same beautiful self consistency as mine. Having dispensed with the future, we can now focus on the past, which is much more interesting:

@article{Tononi94,
	Abstract = {
                In brains of higher vertebrates, the functional segregation of local areas that differ in their anatomy and physiology contrasts sharply with their global integration during perception and behavior. In this paper, we introduce a measure, called neural complexity ({CN}), that captures the interplay between these two fundamental aspects of brain organization. We express functional segregation within a neural system in terms of the relative statistical independence of small subsets of the system and functional integration in terms of significant deviations from independence of large subsets. {CN} is then obtained from estimates of the average deviation from statistical independence for subsets of increasing size. {CN} is shown to be high when functional segregation coexists with integration and to be low when the components of a system are either completely independent (segregated) or completely dependent (integrated). We apply this complexity measure in computer simulations of cortical areas to examine how some basic principles of neuroanatomical organization constrain brain dynamics. We show that the connectivity patterns of the cerebral cortex, such as a high density of connections, strong local connectivity organizing cells into neuronal groups, patchiness in the connectivity among neuronal groups, and prevalent reciprocal connections, are associated with high values of {CN}. The approach outlined here may prove useful in analyzing complexity in other biological domains such as gene regulation and embryogenesis.

                The connection matrix of the human brain (the human "connectome") represents an indispensable foundation for basic and applied neurobiological research. However, the network of anatomical connections linking the neuronal elements of the human brain is still largely unknown. While some databases or collations of large-scale anatomical connection patterns exist for other mammalian species, there is currently no connection matrix of the human brain, nor is there a coordinated research effort to collect, archive, and disseminate this important information. We propose a research strategy to achieve this goal, and discuss its potential impact.

	Abstract = {Despite saccades changing the image on the retina several times per second, we still perceive a stable visual world. A possible mechanism underlying this stability is that an internal retinotopic map is updated with each saccade, with the location of objects being compared before and after the saccade. Psychophysical experiments have shown that humans derive such location information from a corollary discharge ({CD}) accompanying saccades. Such a {CD} has been identified in the monkey brain in a circuit extending from superior colliculus to frontal cortex. There is a missing piece, however. Perceptual localization is established only in humans and the {CD} circuit only in monkeys. We therefore extended measurement of perceptual localization to the monkey by adapting the target displacement detection task developed in humans. During saccades to targets, the target disappeared and then reappeared, sometimes at a different location. The monkeys reported the displacement direction. Detections of displacement were similar in monkeys and humans, but enhanced detection of displacement from blanking the target at the end of the saccade was observed only in humans, not in monkeys. Saccade amplitude varied across trials, but the monkey's estimates of target location did not follow that variation, indicating that eye location depended on an internal {CD} rather than external visual information. We conclude that monkeys use a {CD} to determine their new eye location after each saccade, just as humans do.},

	Abstract = {Why does public conflict over societal risks persist in the face of compelling and widely accessible scientific evidence? We conducted an experiment to probe two alternative answers: the  '' Science Comprehension Thesis'' ({SCT}), which identifies defects in the public's knowledge and reasoning capacities as the source of such controversies; and the  '' Identity-protective Cognition Thesis'' ({ICT}) which treats cultural conflict as disabling the faculties that members of the public use to make sense of decision-relevant science. In our experiment, we presented subjects with a difficult problem that turned on their ability to draw valid causal inferences from empirical data. As expected, subjects highest in Numeracy --- a measure of the ability and disposition to make use of quantitative information --- did substantially better than less numerate ones when the data were presented as results from a study of a new skin-rash treatment. Also as expected, subjects' responses became politically polarized --- and even less accurate --- when the same data were presented as results from the study of a gun-control ban. But contrary to the prediction of {SCT}, such polarization did not abate among subjects highest in Numeracy; instead, it increased. This outcome supported {ICT}, which predicted that more Numerate subjects would use their quantitative-reasoning capacity selectively to conform their interpretation of the data to the result most consistent with their political outlooks. We discuss the theoretical and practical significance of these findings.},

	Abstract = {Treatment of the predictive aspect of statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference is extended to the density-matrix formalism and applied to a discussion of the relation between irreversibility and information loss. A principle of "statistical complementarity" is pointed out, according to which the empirically verifiable probabilities of statistical mechanics necessarily correspond to incomplete predictions. A preliminary discussion is given of the second law of thermodynamics and of a certain class of irreversible processes, in an approximation equivalent to that of the semiclassical theory of {radiation.It} is shown that a density matrix does not in general contain all the information about a system that is relevant for predicting its behavior. In the case of a system perturbed by random fluctuating fields, the density matrix cannot satisfy any differential equation because ρ̇(t) does not depend only on ρ(t), but also on past conditions The rigorous theory involves stochastic equations in the type {ρ(t)=G}(t, 0)ρ(0), where the operator G is a functional of conditions during the entire interval (0→t). Therefore a general theory of irreversible processes cannot be based on differential rate equations corresponding to time-proportional transition probabilities. However, such equations often represent useful approximations.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the neocortex receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). Simple circuits show that an effective {FFI} changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective {FFI} increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {
                The importance of the large number of thin-diameter and unmyelinated axons that connect different cortical areas is unknown. The pronounced propagation delays in these axons may prevent synchronization of cortical networks and therefore hinder efficient information integration and processing. Yet, such global information integration across cortical areas is vital for higher cognitive function. We hypothesized that delays in communication between cortical areas can disrupt synchronization and therefore enhance the set of activity trajectories and computations interconnected networks can perform. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the effect of long-range cortical projections with propagation delays in interconnected large-scale cortical networks that exhibited spontaneous rhythmic activity. Long-range connections with delays caused the emergence of metastable, spatio-temporally distinct activity states between which the networks spontaneously transitioned. Interestingly, the observed activity patterns correspond to macroscopic network dynamics such as globally synchronized activity, propagating wave fronts, and spiral waves that have been previously observed in neurophysiological recordings from humans and animal models. Transient perturbations with simulated transcranial alternating current stimulation ({tACS}) confirmed the multistability of the interconnected networks by switching the networks between these metastable states. Our model thus proposes that slower long-range connections enrich the landscape of activity states and represent a parsimonious mechanism for the emergence of multistability in cortical networks. These results further provide a mechanistic link between the known deficits in connectivity and cortical state dynamics in neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia and autism, as well as suggest non-invasive brain stimulation as an effective treatment for these illnesses.

	Abstract = {The phenomenology and cellular mechanisms of cortical synaptic plasticity are becoming known in increasing detail, but the computational principles by which cortical plasticity enables the development of sensory representations are unclear. Here we describe a framework for cortical synaptic plasticity termed the  '' Convallis rule'', mathematically derived from a principle of unsupervised learning via constrained optimization. Implementation of the rule caused a recurrent cortex-like network of simulated spiking neurons to develop rate representations of real-world speech stimuli, enabling classification by a downstream linear decoder. Applied to spike patterns used in in vitro plasticity experiments, the rule reproduced multiple results including and beyond {STDP}. However {STDP} alone produced poorer learning performance. The mathematical form of the rule is consistent with a dual coincidence detector mechanism that has been suggested by experiments in several synaptic classes of juvenile neocortex. Based on this confluence of normative, phenomenological, and mechanistic evidence, we suggest that the rule may approximate a fundamental computational principle of the neocortex. The circuits of the sensory cortex are able to extract useful information from sensory inputs because of their exquisitely organized synaptic connections. These connections are wired largely through experience-dependent synaptic plasticity. Although many details of both the phenomena and cellular mechanisms of cortical synaptic plasticity are now known, an understanding of the computational principles by which synaptic plasticity wires cortical networks lags far behind this experimental data. In this study, we provide a theoretical framework for cortical plasticity termed the  '' Convallis rule''. The computational power of this rule is demonstrated by its ability to cause simulated cortical networks to learn representations of real-world speech data. Application of the rule to paradigms used to probe synaptic plasticity in vitro reproduced a large number of experimental findings, and the mathematical form of the rule is consistent with a dual coincidence detector mechanism that has been suggested experimentally in juvenile neocortex. Based on this confluence of normative, phenomenological, and mechanistic evidence, we suggest that the rule may approximate a fundamental computational principle of the neocortex.},

	Abstract = {
                The computation represented by a sensory neuron's response to stimuli is constructed from an array of physiological processes both belonging to that neuron and inherited from its inputs. Although many of these physiological processes are known to be nonlinear, linear approximations are commonly used to describe the stimulus selectivity of sensory neurons (i.e., linear receptive fields). Here we present an approach for modeling sensory processing, termed the Nonlinear Input Model ({NIM}), which is based on the hypothesis that the dominant nonlinearities imposed by physiological mechanisms arise from rectification of a neuron's inputs. Incorporating such 'upstream nonlinearities' within the standard linear-nonlinear ({LN}) cascade modeling structure implicitly allows for the identification of multiple stimulus features driving a neuron's response, which become directly interpretable as either excitatory or inhibitory. Because its form is analogous to an integrate-and-fire neuron receiving excitatory and inhibitory inputs, model fitting can be guided by prior knowledge about the inputs to a given neuron, and elements of the resulting model can often result in specific physiological predictions. Furthermore, by providing an explicit probabilistic model with a relatively simple nonlinear structure, its parameters can be efficiently optimized and appropriately regularized. Parameter estimation is robust and efficient even with large numbers of model components and in the context of high-dimensional stimuli with complex statistical structure (e.g. natural stimuli). We describe detailed methods for estimating the model parameters, and illustrate the advantages of the {NIM} using a range of example sensory neurons in the visual and auditory systems. We thus present a modeling framework that can capture a broad range of nonlinear response functions while providing physiologically interpretable descriptions of neural computation.

Rodolfo Llinas of the {NYU} School of Medicine continues this tradition of
quietly tackling the deepest issues in {\_I} of the Vortex\_. This exposition on
the evolution and development of consciousness is accessible and intriguing
enough to interest readers more philosophically than scientifically oriented.
Grounded in research, the book posits our awareness as an artefact of the
cortico-thalamic binding of perceptions and movements in synchrony; Llinas
uses this theory as a launching pad for more far-reaching considerations of
selfhood all the more relevant for their correlation with the facts.
Charmingly illustrated with artistic and scientific images cleverly supporting
the arguments, the book is a quick if challenging read and explains all the
scientific basics for those approaching from the humanities. Synthesising
evolution, philosophy and neuroscience is becoming an increasingly popular
endeavour for introspective eggheads, and we should be grateful: the question
of consciousness affects us all and touches on every other field from theology
to particle physics. {\_I} of the Vortex\_ is a welcome contribution to the theory
of mind and essential reading for the introspective. --{\_Rob} Lightner\_},

This is mainly due to previous {fMRI} studies using paradigms in which the eye movements cannot be segregated from the storage of this motion information. To avoid this problem we used a novel paradigm designed in our lab in which we interlaced a delay (2, 4 or 6 seconds) between the 1st and 2nd presentation of a moving stimulus. Using this design we could examine brain activity during a delay period using {fMRI} and have subsequently found a number of brain areas that reveal sustained activity during predictive pursuit. These areas include, the V5 complex and superior parietal lobe. This study provides new evidence for the network involved in the storage of visual information to generate early motor responses in pursuit.},

	Comment = {* "In generalised formulations of hierarchical predictive coding, there are three sorts of expectation: expected 'causes', 'states', and 'precisions' [15]. Causes are invariant aspects of the world that create regularities in sensory data, such as objects in the visual scene. Their correspondence to elements of the scene is concrete at lower levels (e.g., a colour), and increasingly abstract at higher levels of the hierarchy (e.g., a smile). Whereas causes model categorical aspects of the world, states model their dynamics; that is, the fluctuations caused by the interactions among causes (e.g., motion of an object) or between cause and context (e.g., a rotating object and its illumination). Finally, precision corresponds to the reliability (inverse amplitude of random fluctuations) of causes and states. Therefore, expected precision determines the relative confidence in descending predictions and ascending prediction error." * "How should lateral connections be interpreted? Anatomically, lateral connections appear to be a superposition of the forward and backward laminar patterns [5]. A literal functional interpretation would require laterally interconnected areas to be computing two distinct sets of causes, distinguished by a mutually reversed hierarchical order. An alternative is to consider computations relating to states that are not hierarchically ordered, but may still make use of interareal communication. If we envisage the expectation, prediction error and precision units for states to occupy the same layers as their equivalent neurons for causes, a symmetrical exchange of signals relating to states could easily generate broad laminar distributions of origins and terminations, as observed for the 'intermediate' laminar pattern of lateral connections."},

	Abstract = {
                Population codes assume that neural systems represent sensory inputs through the firing rates of populations of differently tuned neurons. However, trial-by-trial variability and noise correlations are known to affect the information capacity of neural codes. Although recent studies have shown that stimulus presentation reduces both variability and rate correlations with respect to their spontaneous level, possibly improving the encoding accuracy, whether these second order statistics are tuned is unknown. If so, second-order statistics could themselves carry information, rather than being invariably detrimental. Here we show that rate variability and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus direction in directionally selective middle temporal ({MT}) neurons, leading to characteristic tuning curves. We show that such tuning emerges in a stochastic recurrent network, for a set of connectivity parameters that overlaps with a single-state scenario and multistability. Information theoretic analysis shows that second-order statistics carry information that can improve the accuracy of the population code.

	Abstract = {Cortical neurons in vivo respond to sensory stimuli with the generation of action potentials that can show a high degree of variability in both their number and timing with repeated presentations as wells as, on occasion, a high degree of synchronization with other cortical neurons, including in the gamma frequency range of 30-70 Hz. Here we examined whether or not this variability may arise from the intrinsic mechanisms of action potential generation in cortical regular spiking, fast spiking and intrinsic burst-generating neurons maintained in vitro. For this purpose, we performed intracellular recordings in slices of ferret visual cortex and activated these cells with the intracellular injection of various current waveforms. Some of these waveforms were derived from barrages of postsynaptic potentials evoked by visual stimulation recorded in vivo; others were artificially created and contained various amounts of gamma range fluctuations; finally, others consisted of swept-sinewave current ({ZAP} current) functions. Using such stimuli, we found that, as expected given the resistive and capacitive properties of cortical neurons, low frequencies have a larger effect on the membrane potential of cortical neurons than do higher frequencies. However, increasing the amount of gamma range fluctuations in a stimulus leads to more precise timing of action potentials. This suggests that different frequencies play different roles, low frequencies being efficient for depolarizing cells with high frequencies increasing the precision of action potential timing. In parallel to increases in temporal precision, the addition of higher frequency components increases the range of interspike intervals present in the action potential discharge. These results suggest that higher frequency components such as gamma range fluctuations may facilitate the generation of action potentials with a high temporal precision while at the same time exhibiting a high degree of variability in interspike intervals on single trials. This temporal precision may facilitate the use of temporal codes or the generation of precise synchronization for the transmission and analysis of information within cortical networks.},

                Background: Visual scanpath analyses provide important information about attention allocation and attention shifting during visual exploration of social situations. This study investigated whether patients with schizophrenia simply show restricted free visual exploration behavior reflected by reduced saccade frequency and increased fixation duration or whether patients use qualitatively different exploration strategies than healthy controls. Methods: Scanpaths of 32 patients with schizophrenia and age-matched 33 healthy controls were assessed while participants freely explored six photos of daily life situations (20 s/photo) evaluated for cognitive complexity and emotional strain. Using fixation and saccade parameters, we compared temporal changes in exploration behavior, cluster analyses, attentional landscapes, and analyses of scanpath similarities between both groups. Results: We found fewer fixation clusters, longer fixation durations within a cluster, fewer changes between clusters, and a greater increase of fixation duration over time in patients compared to controls. Scanpath patterns and attentional landscapes in patients also differed significantly from those of controls. Generally, cognitive complexity and emotional strain had significant effects on visual exploration behavior. This effect was similar in both groups as were physical properties of fixation locations. Conclusions: Longer attention allocation to a given feature in a scene and less attention shifts in patients suggest a more focal processing mode compared to a more ambient exploration strategy in controls. These visual exploration alterations were present in patients independently of cognitive complexity, emotional strain or physical properties of visual cues implying that they represent a rather general deficit. Despite this impairment, patients were able to adapt their scanning behavior to changes in cognitive complexity and emotional strain similar to controls.

	Abstract = { Human {OFRs} were studied using narrow sinusoidal strip in counterphase. Retinal receptive fields were modeled as a difference of two {2-D} Gaussian functions. Non-oriented center/surround antagonistic filters (retina, {LGN}) accounted for the data. Ocular following responses ({OFRs}) are the initial tracking eye movements elicited at ultra-short latency by sudden motion of a textured pattern. We wished to evaluate quantitatively the impact that subcortical stages of visual processing might have on the {OFRs}. In three experiments we recorded the {OFRs} of human subjects to brief horizontal motion of {1D} vertical sine-wave gratings restricted to an elongated horizontal aperture. Gratings were composed of a variable number of abutting horizontal strips where alternate strips were in counterphase. In one of the experiments we also utilized gratings occupying a variable number of horizontal strips separated vertically by mean-luminance gaps. We modeled retinal center/surround receptive fields as a difference of two {2-D} Gaussian functions. When the characteristics of such local filters were selected in accord with the known properties of primate retinal ganglion cells, a single-layer model was capable to quantitatively account for the observed changes in the {OFR} amplitude for stimuli composed of counterphase strips of different heights (Experiment 1), for a wide range of stimulus contrasts (Experiment 2) and spatial frequencies (Experiment 3). A similar model using oriented filters that resemble cortical simple cells was also able to account for these data. Since similar filters can be constructed from the linear summation of retinal filters, and these filters alone can explain the data, we conclude that retinal processing determines the response to these stimuli. Thus, with appropriately chosen stimuli, {OFRs} can be used to study visual spatial integration processes as early as in the retina.},

The importance of emulating brain function when building models is emphasized. We argue against reliance on emergent behavior in neural simulations. We provide an overview and comparison of several recent large-scale brain models. In addition to discussing challenges involved with building large neural models, we identify several expected benefits of pursuing such a research program. We argue that these benefits are only likely to be realized if two basic guidelines are made central to the pursuit. The first is that such models need to be intimately tied to behavior. The second is that models, and more importantly their underlying methods, should provide mechanisms for varying the level of simulated detail. Consequently, we express concerns with models that insist on a 'correct' amount of detail while expecting interesting behavior to simply emerge.},

	Abstract = {Much research over the last decade has examined how the brain links local activity within primary visual cortex to signal the presence of extended global structure. Here we bring together two themes within this area by addressing how the immediate context that features arise in influences how they are integrated into contours. Specifically, observers were required to detect and discriminate the shape of contours that were surrounded by elements with a fixed orientation offset compared to contour elements. By comparing performance with contours made of elements oriented either near parallel ( '' snakes'') or near perpendicular ( '' ladders'') to the contour orientation, we were able to isolate the effect of orientation contrast on observers' ability to perform our task with near-collinear contour structure. We report both substantial facilitation of contour integration in the presence of near-perpendicular surrounds and inhibition in the presence of near-parallel surrounds. These results are consistent with known orientation dependence of suppressive surround interactions in the primary visual cortex and suggest that the  '' rules of association'' for contour integration must incorporate the influence of local orientation context. Specifically we show that our results are consistent with contour integration relying on an opponent-orientation energy response from a bank of first-stage oriented filters.},

	Abstract = {
                This paper reviews recent developments under the free energy principle that introduce a normative perspective on classical economic (utilitarian) decision-making based on (active) Bayesian inference. It has been suggested that the free energy principle precludes novelty and complexity, because it assumes that biological systems-like ourselves-try to minimize the long-term average of surprise to maintain their homeostasis. However, recent formulations show that minimizing surprise leads naturally to concepts such as exploration and novelty bonuses. In this approach, agents infer a policy that minimizes surprise by minimizing the difference (or relative entropy) between likely and desired outcomes, which involves both pursuing the goal-state that has the highest expected utility (often termed "exploitation") and visiting a number of different goal-states ("exploration"). Crucially, the opportunity to visit new states increases the value of the current state. Casting decision-making problems within a variational framework, therefore, predicts that our behavior is governed by both the entropy and expected utility of future states. This dissolves any dialectic between minimizing surprise and exploration or novelty seeking.

	Abstract = {
                Visual cortex analyzes images by first extracting relevant details (e.g., edges) via a large array of specialized detectors. The resulting edge map is then relayed to a processing pipeline, the final goal of which is to attribute meaning to the scene. As this process unfolds, does the global interpretation of the image affect how local feature detectors operate? We characterized the local properties of human edge detectors while we manipulated the extent to which the statistical properties of the surrounding image conformed to those encountered in natural vision. Although some aspects of local processing were unaffected by contextual manipulations, we observed significant alterations in the operating characteristics of the detector which were solely attributable to a higher-level semantic interpretation of the scene, unrelated to lower-level aspects of image statistics. Our results suggest that it may be inaccurate to regard early feature detectors as operating outside the domain of higher-level vision; although there is validity in this approach, a full understanding of their properties requires the inclusion of knowledge-based effects specific to the statistical regularities found in the natural environment.

It consists of the largely unexpected result that higher-level manipulations of image content (i.e., inverting the image upside-down) altered the characteristics of local edge detectors employed by the human observers for feature extraction (see Figure ​Figure15).15). No existing model can account for this effect. Our results demonstrate that even the earliest and simplest stages in human visual processing cannot be fully understood as operating completely outside the domain of higher-level processing; a comprehensive account of low-level vision requires that feature detectors are characterized not only within the controlled parameter range spanned by artificial stimuli (Rust and Movshon, 2005), but also within the operating regime afforded by natural statistics (Felsen and Dan, 2005).},

At the retina level, a spatio-temporal filtering ensures accurate structuring of video data (noise and illumination variation removal, static and dynamic contour enhancement). In the V1 cortex, a frequency and orientation based analysis is performed. The combined use of retina and V1 cortex modeling allows the development of low level image processing modules for contour enhancement, for moving contour extraction, for motion analysis and for motion event detection.

	Abstract = {Recurrent neural networks ({RNNs}) are widely used in computational neuroscience and machine learning applications. In an {RNN}, each neuron computes its output as a nonlinear function of its integrated input. While the importance of {RNNs}, especially as models of brain processing, is undisputed, it is also widely acknowledged that the computations in standard {RNN} models may be an over-simplification of what real neuronal networks compute. Here, we suggest that the {RNN} approach may be made computationally more powerful by its fusion with Bayesian inference techniques for nonlinear dynamical systems. In this scheme, we use an {RNN} as a generative model of dynamic input caused by the environment, e.g. of speech or kinematics. Given this generative {RNN} model, we derive Bayesian update equations that can decode its output. Critically, these updates define a 'recognizing {RNN}' ({rRNN}), in which neurons compute and exchange prediction and prediction error messages. The {rRNN} has several desirable features that a conventional {RNN} does not have, e.g. fast decoding of dynamic stimuli and robustness to initial conditions and noise. Furthermore, it implements a predictive coding scheme for dynamic inputs. We suggest that the Bayesian inversion of {RNNs} may be useful both as a model of brain function and as a machine learning tool. We illustrate the use of the {rRNN} by an application to the online decoding (i.e. recognition) of human kinematics.},

	Abstract = {
                This paper considers agency in the setting of embodied or active inference. In brief, we associate a sense of agency with prior beliefs about action and ask what sorts of beliefs underlie optimal behavior. In particular, we consider prior beliefs that action minimizes the {Kullback-Leibler} ({KL}) divergence between desired states and attainable states in the future. This allows one to formulate bounded rationality as approximate Bayesian inference that optimizes a free energy bound on model evidence. We show that constructs like expected utility, exploration bonuses, softmax choice rules and optimism bias emerge as natural consequences of this formulation. Previous accounts of active inference have focused on predictive coding and Bayesian filtering schemes for minimizing free energy. Here, we consider variational Bayes as an alternative scheme that provides formal constraints on the computational anatomy of inference and action-constraints that are remarkably consistent with neuroanatomy. Furthermore, this scheme contextualizes optimal decision theory and economic (utilitarian) formulations as pure inference problems. For example, expected utility theory emerges as a special case of free energy minimization, where the sensitivity or inverse temperature (of softmax functions and quantal response equilibria) has a unique and Bayes-optimal solution-that minimizes free energy. This sensitivity corresponds to the precision of beliefs about behavior, such that attainable goals are afforded a higher precision or confidence. In turn, this means that optimal behavior entails a representation of confidence about outcomes that are under an agent's control.

However, its contribution to the selection of a preferred outcome among different reward options is still unclear. We investigated the effect of transient {OFC} inactivation (achieved by presession injection of muscimol and baclofen) in a novel two-reward choice task. In discrete trials, rats could choose between a solution of polycose and an equally caloric, but highly preferred, solution of sucrose by visiting one of two liquid dispensers after the presentation of a specific cue signaling the availability of one or both of the solutions. We found that {OFC} inactivation did not affect outcome preference: rats maintained high preference for sucrose and adapted their behavioral responding when the cue--outcome contingencies were reversed. However, when rats were tested drug-free 24 h after {OFC} inactivation and reversal learning, memory for the newly learned contingencies was poor. These results suggest a potential conflict between {OFC} (encoding pre-reversal contingencies) and other brain circuits (encoding the new contingencies). Remarkably, repeating the {OFC} inactivation before the reversal memory test restored normal behavior, confirming the hypothesis of a dominant impact of {OFC} on other decision-making circuits. These results indicate that the representations encoded in the {OFC}, while not essential to the expression of outcome preference, exert hierarchical control on downstream decision-making circuits.},

	Abstract = {
                The sparse coding hypothesis has generated significant interest in the computational and theoretical neuroscience communities, but there remain open questions about the exact quantitative form of the sparsity penalty and the implementation of such a coding rule in neurally plausible architectures. The main contribution of this work is to show that a wide variety of sparsity-based probabilistic inference problems proposed in the signal processing and statistics literatures can be implemented exactly in the common network architecture known as the locally competitive algorithm ({LCA}). Among the cost functions we examine are approximate l(p) norms (0 ≤ p ≤ 2), modified l(p)-norms, block-l1 norms, and reweighted algorithms. Of particular interest is that we show significantly increased performance in reweighted l1 algorithms by inferring all parameters jointly in a dynamical system rather than using an iterative approach native to digital computational architectures.

These algorithms use thresholding functions to induce local (usually one-way) inhibitory competitions between nodes to produce sparse representations. {LCAs} produce coefficients with sparsity levels comparable to the most popular centralized sparse coding algorithms while being readily suited for neural implementation. Additionally, {LCA} coefficients for video sequences demonstrate inertial properties that are both qualitatively and quantitatively more regular (i.e., smoother and more predictable) than the coefficients produced by greedy algorithms.},

                Object vision in human and nonhuman primates is often cited as a primary example of adult plasticity in neural information processing. It has been hypothesized that visual experience leads to single neurons in the monkey brain with strong selectivity for complex objects, and to regions in the human brain with a preference for particular categories of highly familiar objects. This view suggests that adult visual experience causes dramatic local changes in the response properties of high-level visual cortex. Here, we review the current neurophysiological and neuroimaging evidence and find that the available data support a different conclusion: adult visual experience introduces moderate, relatively distributed effects that modulate a pre-existing, rich and flexible set of neural object representations.

	Abstract = {
                The representations of animate and inanimate objects appear to be anatomically and functionally dissociated in the primate brain. How much of the variation in object-category tuning across cortical locations can be explained in terms of the animate/inanimate distinction? How is the distinction between animate and inanimate reflected in the arrangement of object representations along the cortical surface? To investigate these issues we recorded {BOLD} activity in visual cortex while subjects viewed streams of natural scenes. We then constructed an explicit model of object-category tuning for each voxel along the cortical surface. We verified that these models accurately predict responses to novel scenes for voxels located in anterior visual areas, and that they can be used to accurately decode multiple objects simultaneously from novel scenes. Finally, we used principal components analysis to characterize the variation in object-category tuning across voxels. Remarkably, we found that the first principal component reflects the distinction between animate and inanimate objects. This dimension accounts for between 50 and 60\% of the total variation in object-category tuning across voxels in anterior visual areas. The importance of the animate-inanimate distinction is further reflected in the arrangement of voxels on the cortical surface: voxels that prefer animate objects tend to be located anterior to retinotopic visual areas and are flanked by voxels that prefer inanimate objects. Our explicit model of object-category tuning thus explains the anatomical and functional dissociation of animate and inanimate objects.

	Abstract = {A considerable number of recent experimental and computational studies suggest that subtle impairments of excitatory to inhibitory balance or regulation are involved in many neurological and psychiatric conditions. The current paper aims to relate, specifically and quantitatively, excitatory to inhibitory imbalance with psychotic symptoms in schizophrenia. Considering that the brain constructs hierarchical causal models of the external world, we show that the failure to maintain the excitatory to inhibitory balance results in hallucinations as well as in the formation and subsequent consolidation of delusional beliefs. Indeed, the consequence of excitatory to inhibitory imbalance in a hierarchical neural network is equated to a pathological form of causal inference called 'circular belief propagation'. In circular belief propagation, bottom-up sensory information and top-down predictions are reverberated, i.e. prior beliefs are misinterpreted as sensory observations and vice versa. As a result, these predictions are counted multiple times. Circular inference explains the emergence of erroneous percepts, the patient's overconfidence when facing probabilistic choices, the learning of 'unshakable' causal relationships between unrelated events and a paradoxical immunity to perceptual illusions, which are all known to be associated with schizophrenia.},

@article{Baldassi13,
	Abstract = {
                The anterior inferotemporal cortex ({IT}) is the highest stage along the hierarchy of visual areas that, in primates, processes visual objects. Although several lines of evidence suggest that {IT} primarily represents visual shape information, some recent studies have argued that neuronal ensembles in {IT} code the semantic membership of visual objects (i.e., represent conceptual classes such as animate and inanimate objects). In this study, we investigated to what extent semantic, rather than purely visual information, is represented in {IT} by performing a multivariate analysis of {IT} responses to a set of visual objects. By relying on a variety of machine-learning approaches (including a cutting-edge clustering algorithm that has been recently developed in the domain of statistical physics), we found that, in most instances, {IT} representation of visual objects is accounted for by their similarity at the level of shape or, more surprisingly, low-level visual properties. Only in a few cases we observed {IT} representations of semantic classes that were not explainable by the visual similarity of their members. Overall, these findings reassert the primary function of {IT} as a conveyor of explicit visual shape information, and reveal that low-level visual properties are represented in {IT} to a greater extent than previously appreciated. In addition, our work demonstrates how combining a variety of state-of-the-art multivariate approaches, and carefully estimating the contribution of shape similarity to the representation of object categories, can substantially advance our understanding of neuronal coding of visual objects in cortex.

@article{Lehky13,
	Abstract = {Current population coding methods, including weighted averaging and Bayesian estimation, are based on extrinsic representations. These require that neurons be labeled with response parameters, such as tuning curve peaks or noise distributions, which are tied to some external, world-based metric scale. Firing rates alone, without this external labeling, are insufficient to represent a variable. However, the extrinsic approach does not explain how such neural labeling is implemented. A radically different and perhaps more physiological approach is based on intrinsic representations, which have access only to firing rates. Because neurons are unlabeled, intrinsic coding represents relative, rather than absolute, values of a variable. We show that intrinsic coding has representational advantages, including invariance, categorization, and discrimination, and in certain situations it may also recover absolute stimulus values.},

	Abstract = {While the predictive nature of the primate smooth pursuit system has been evident through several behavioural and neurophysiological experiments, few models have attempted to explain these results comprehensively. The model we propose in this paper in line with previous models employing optimal control theory; however, we hypothesize two new issues: (1) the medical superior temporal ({MST}) area in the cerebral cortex implements a recurrent neural network ({RNN}) in order to predict the current or future target velocity, and (2) a forward model of the target motion is acquired by on-line learning. We use stimulation studies to demonstrate how our new model supports these hypotheses.},

	Abstract = {Homeostatic intrinsic plasticity ({HIP}) is a ubiquitous cellular mechanism regulating neuronal activity, cardinal for the proper functioning of nervous systems. In invertebrates, {HIP} is critical for orchestrating stereotyped activity patterns. The functional impact of {HIP} remains more obscure in vertebrate networks, where higher order cognitive processes rely on complex neural dynamics. The hypothesis has emerged that {HIP} might control the complexity of activity dynamics in recurrent networks, with important computational consequences. However, conflicting results about the causal relationships between cellular {HIP}, network dynamics, and computational performance have arisen from machine-learning studies. Here, we assess how cellular {HIP} effects translate into collective dynamics and computational properties in biological recurrent networks. We develop a realistic multiscale model including a generic {HIP} rule regulating the neuronal threshold with actual molecular signaling pathways kinetics, Dale's principle, sparse connectivity, synaptic balance, and Hebbian synaptic plasticity ({SP}). Dynamic mean-field analysis and simulations unravel that {HIP} sets a working point at which inputs are transduced by large derivative ranges of the transfer function. This cellular mechanism ensures increased network dynamics complexity, robust balance with {SP} at the edge of chaos, and improved input separability. Although critically dependent upon balanced excitatory and inhibitory drives, these effects display striking robustness to changes in network architecture, learning rates, and input features. Thus, the mechanism we unveil might represent a ubiquitous cellular basis for complex dynamics in neural networks. Understanding this robustness is an important challenge to unraveling principles underlying self-organization around criticality in biological recurrent neural networks.},

	Abstract = {Neural delays are a general property of computations carried out by neural circuits. Delays are a natural consequence of temporal summation and coding used by the nervous system to integrate information from multiple resources. For adaptive behaviour, however, these delays must be compensated. In order to sense and interact with moving objects, for example, the visual system must predict the future position of the object to compensate for delays. In this paper, we address two critical questions concerning the implementation of the compensation mechanisms in the brain, namely, where does compensation occur and how is it realized. We present evidence showing that compensation can happen in both the motor and sensory systems, and that compensation using 'diagonal neural pathways' is a suitable strategy for implementing compensation in the visual system. In this strategy, neural signals in the early stage of information processing are sent to the future cortical positions that correspond to the distance the object will travel in the period of transmission delay. We propose a computational model to elucidate this using the retinal visual information pathway.},

	Abstract = {Psychedelic drugs produce profound changes in consciousness, but the underlying neurobiological mechanisms for this remain unclear. Spontaneous and induced oscillatory activity was recorded in healthy human participants with magnetoencephalography after intravenous infusion of psilocybin---prodrug of the nonselective serotonin {2A} receptor agonist and classic psychedelic psilocin. Psilocybin reduced spontaneous cortical oscillatory power from 1 to 50 Hz in posterior association cortices, and from 8 to 100 Hz in frontal association cortices. Large decreases in oscillatory power were seen in areas of the default-mode network. Independent component analysis was used to identify a number of resting-state networks, and activity in these was similarly decreased after psilocybin. Psilocybin had no effect on low-level visually induced and motor-induced gamma-band oscillations, suggesting that some basic elements of oscillatory brain activity are relatively preserved during the psychedelic experience. Dynamic causal modeling revealed that posterior cingulate cortex desynchronization can be explained by increased excitability of deep-layer pyramidal neurons, which are known to be rich in {5-HT2A} receptors. These findings suggest that the subjective effects of psychedelics result from a desynchronization of ongoing oscillatory rhythms in the cortex, likely triggered by {5-HT2A} receptor-mediated excitation of deep pyramidal cells.},

                Every eye movement produces a shift in the visual image on the retina. The receptive field, or retinal response area, of an individual visual neuron moves with the eyes so that after an eye movement it covers a new portion of visual space. For some parietal neurons, the location of the receptive field is shown to shift transiently before an eye movement. In addition, nearly all parietal neurons respond when an eye movement brings the site of a previously flashed stimulus into the receptive field. Parietal cortex both anticipates the retinal consequences of eye movements and updates the retinal coordinates of remembered stimuli to generate a continuously accurate representation of visual space.

	Abstract = {
                We examined simultaneously recorded spikes from multiple rat grid cells, to explain mechanisms underlying their activity. Among grid cells with similar spatial periods, the population activity was confined to lie close to a two-dimensional ({2D}) manifold: grid cells differed only along two dimensions of their responses and otherwise were nearly identical. Relationships between cell pairs were conserved despite extensive deformations of single-neuron responses. Results from novel environments suggest such structure is not inherited from hippocampal or external sensory inputs. Across conditions, cell-cell relationships are better conserved than responses of single cells. Finally, the system is continually subject to perturbations that, were the {2D} manifold not attractive, would drive the system to inhabit a different region of state space than observed. These findings have strong implications for theories of grid-cell activity and substantiate the general hypothesis that the brain computes using low-dimensional continuous attractors.

Unfortunately, existing models of the visual environment are either unrealistic or too complex for mathematical description. Here we describe a naturalistic image model and present a mathematical solution for the statistical relationships between the image features and model variables. The world described by this model is composed of independent, opaque, textured objects, which occlude each other. This simple structure allows us to calculate the joint probability distribution of image values sampled at multiple arbitrarily located points, without approximation. This result can be converted into probabilistic relationships between observable image features as well as between the unobservable properties that caused these features, including object boundaries and relative depth. We show that the image model is sufficient to explain a wide range of natural scene properties. Finally, we discuss the implications of this description of natural scenes for the study of vision.},

It attempts to draw connections between ideas from computational vision and findings from awake primate electrophysiology. In the classical feed-forward, modular view of visual processing, the early visual areas ({LGN}, V1 and V2) are modules that serve to extract local features, while higher extrastriate areas are responsible for shape inference and invariant object recognition. However, recent findings in primate early visual systems reveal that the computations in the early visual cortex are rather complex and dynamic, as well as interactive and plastic, subject to influence from global context, higher order perceptual inference, task requirement and behavioral experience. The evidence argues that the early visual cortex does not merely participate in the first stage of visual processing, but is involved in many levels of visual computation.},

	Abstract = {Can the organization of local edge measurements into curves be directly related to natural image structure? By viewing curve organization as a statistical estimation problem, we suggest that it can. In particular, the classical Gestalt perceptual organization cues of proximity and good continuation---the basis of many current curve organization systems---can be statistically measured in images. As a prior for our estimation approach we introduce the curve indicator random field. In contrast to other techniques that require contour closure or are based on a sparse set of detected edges, the curve indicator random field emphasizes the short-distance, dense nature of organizing curve elements into (possibly) open curves. Its explicit formulation allows the calculation of its properties such as its autocorrelation. On the one hand, the curve indicator random field leads us to introduce the oriented Wiener filter, capturing the blur and noise inherent in the edge measurement process. On the other, it suggests we seek such correlations in natural images. We present the results of some initial edge correlation measurements that not only confirm the presence of Gestalt cues, but also suggest that curvature has a role in curve organization.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes that the network dynamics of the mammalian visual cortex are highly structured and strongly shaped by temporally localized barrages of excitatory and inhibitory firing we call 'multiple-firing events' ({MFEs}). Our proposal is based on careful study of a network of spiking neurons built to reflect the coarse physiology of a small patch of layer 2/3 of V1. When appropriately benchmarked this network is capable of reproducing the qualitative features of a range of phenomena observed in the real visual cortex, including spontaneous background patterns, orientation-specific responses, surround suppression and gamma-band oscillations. Detailed investigation into the relevant regimes reveals causal relationships among dynamical events driven by a strong competition between the excitatory and inhibitory populations. It suggests that along with firing rates, {MFE} characteristics can be a powerful signature of a regime. Testable predictions based on model observations and dynamical analysis are proposed.},

	Abstract = {Otolith end organs of vertebrates sense linear accelerations of the head and gravitation. The hair cells on their epithelia are responsible for transduction. In mammals, the striola, parallel to the line where hair cells reverse their polarization, is a narrow region centered on a curve with curvature and torsion. It has been shown that the striolar region is functionally different from the rest, being involved in a phasic vestibular pathway. We propose a mathematical and computational model that explains the necessity of this amazing geometry for the striola to be able to carry out its function. Our hypothesis, related to the biophysics of the hair cells and to the physiology of their afferent neurons, is that striolar afferents collect information from several type I hair cells to detect the jerk in a large domain of acceleration directions. This predicts a mean number of two calyces for afferent neurons, as measured in rodents. The domain of acceleration directions sensed by our striolar model is compatible with the experimental results obtained on monkeys considering all afferents. Therefore, the main result of our study is that phasic and tonic vestibular afferents cover the same geometrical fields, but at different dynamical and frequency domains.},

	Abstract = { Fast (∼hours) emergence of eccentric fixation locus following occluded central vision Rapid rereferencing of saccades to the eccentric fixation locus Learned oculomotor plan is retained for weeks with normal (unoccluded) central vision The central region of the human retina, the fovea, provides high-acuity vision. The oculomotor system continually brings targets of interest into the fovea via ballistic eye movements (saccades). Thus, the fovea serves both as the locus for fixations and as the oculomotor reference for saccades. This highly automated process of foveation is functionally critical to vision and is observed from infancy [1 and 2]. How would the oculomotor system adjust to a loss of foveal vision (central scotoma)? Clinical observations of patients with central vision loss [3 and 4] suggest a lengthy adjustment period [5], but the nature and dynamics of this adjustment remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that the oculomotor system can spontaneously and rapidly adopt a peripheral locus for fixation and can rereference saccades to this locus in normally sighted individuals whose central vision is blocked by an artificial scotoma. Once developed, the fixation locus is retained over weeks in the absence of the simulated scotoma. Our data reveal a basic guiding principle of the oculomotor system that prefers control simplicity over optimality. We demonstrate the importance of a visible scotoma on the speed of the adjustment and suggest a possible rehabilitation regimen for patients with central vision loss.},

	Abstract = {The problem of signal representation in terms of basis vectors
from a large, over-complete, spanning dictionary has been the focus of
much research. Achieving a succinct, or `sparse', representation is
known as the problem of best basis representation. Methods are
considered which seek to solve this problem by sequentially building up
a basis set for the signal. Three distinct algorithm types have appeared
in the literature which are here termed basic matching pursuit ({BMP}),
order recursive matching pursuit ({ORMP}) and modified matching pursuit
({MMP}). The algorithms are first described and then their computation is
closely examined. Modifications are made to each of the procedures which
improve their computational efficiency. The complexity of each algorithm
is considered in two contexts; one where the dictionary is variable
(time-dependent) and the other where the dictionary is fixed
(time-independent). Experimental results are presented which demonstrate
that the {ORMP} method is the best procedure in terms of its ability to
give the most compact signal representation, followed by {MMP} and then
{BMP} which gives the poorest results. Finally, weighing the performance
of each algorithm, its computational complexity and the type of
dictionary available, recommendations are made as to which algorithm
should be used for a given problem},

	Abstract = { We studied how color changes during motion would modulate the flash-lag effect ({FLE}). {FLE} was reduced but survived with a moving object with alternating or random color changes. An unexpected change to a new color in the alternating stream eliminated the {FLE}. Changes in surface feature degrade the maintenance of object file but do not eliminate it. An unexpected change might indicate that multiple objects exist in the stream and thus eliminate {FLE}. When a visual object is briefly flashed, it appears to lag behind another moving object (flash-lag effect; {FLE}). Previous studies showed that a sudden change to the moving object at the time of the flash presentation would eliminate the {FLE}. We examined whether the {FLE} would be eliminated when a sudden color change was embedded in a sequence of color alternations on a moving object. Observers viewed a moving disc, the color of which did not change at all, changed only once when another stationary object flashed, or alternated regularly (Experiment 1) or randomly (Experiment 2) between two colors as it was moving before the flash presentation. Although the magnitude was reduced compared with the no-change condition, the {FLE} observed with the moving object that changed color during motion was significantly stronger than that in the one-change condition. In Experiment 3, the object color alternated between two but unexpectedly changed to a new color when the flash appeared. The elimination of {FLE} in such condition was comparable to the one-change condition, suggesting that the unexpected change restored the salience of the moving object at the time of flash presentation, which spared the observer from perceiving the {FLE}. We propose that, without an unexpected event, rapid changes in the surface feature of the moving object partially degrade the maintenance of object file, but this does not preclude the visual system in registering the existence of only one object in the motion stream.},

	Abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ({dLGN}) receives visual information from the retina and transmits it to the cortex. In this study, we made extracellular recordings in the {dLGN} of both anesthetized and awake mice, and found that a surprisingly high proportion of cells were selective for stimulus orientation. The orientation selectivity of {dLGN} cells was unchanged after silencing the visual cortex pharmacologically, indicating that it is not due to cortical feedback. The orientation tuning of some {dLGN} cells correlated with their elongated receptive fields, while in others orientation selectivity was observed despite the fact that their receptive fields were circular, suggesting that their retinal input might already be orientation selective. Consistently, we revealed orientation/axis-selective ganglion cells in the mouse retina using multielectrode arrays in an in vitro preparation. Furthermore, the orientation tuning of {dLGN} cells was largely maintained at different stimulus contrasts, which could be sufficiently explained by a simple linear feedforward model. We also compared the degree of orientation selectivity in different visual structures under the same recording condition. Compared with the {dLGN}, orientation selectivity is greatly improved in the visual cortex, but is similar in the superior colliculus, another major retinal target. Together, our results demonstrate prominent orientation selectivity in the mouse {dLGN}, which may potentially contribute to visual processing in the cortex.},

	Abstract = {The understanding that many neuronal functional properties are the result of complex interactions within large populations of neurons leads to the development and analysis of large network models. In these models, specificities such as connectivity and architecture of the heterogeneous neuronal population are at least as important as the individual neuronal dynamics in shaping the population's computational power. Unfortunately, designing, building, visualizing and simulating large network models focused on architecture complexity is not straightforward with most neuronal simulation tools. Visualization in particular, either for model construction debugging, online simulation analysis or even classroom demonstrations, is virtually unsupported in neuronal simulators targeting large network models. Here we present the simulation environment {NeuralSyns}, capable of handling models with up to 107 synapses, which offers: i) use of statistical descriptions to define and build large networks; ii) {GUI} tool to construct complex architectures without the need to write code; iii) information-rich graphical representations of the model architecture and dynamical state, before and during the simulations; iv) simulation engine with compact and lean source code, fully commented, and simple to modify/expand; v) possibility to add new models for neurons, synapses and plasticity dynamics. {NeuralSyns} is written in {C/C}++ and relies on {OpenGL} code for its graphical engine. The use of specific {OpenGL} strategies removes rendering burden from the {CPU} (central processing unit) and places it in the {GPU} (graphics processing unit), reducing the simulation slowdown due to the graphical representation.},

	Abstract = {Extensive electrophysiology studies have shown that many V1 simple cells have nonlinear response properties to stimuli within their classical receptive field ({CRF}) and receive contextual influence from stimuli outside the {CRF} modulating the cell's response. Models seeking to explain these non-classical receptive field ({nCRF}) effects in terms of circuit mechanisms, input-output descriptions, or individual visual tasks provide limited insight into the functional significance of these response properties, because they do not connect the full range of {nCRF} effects to optimal sensory coding strategies. The (population) sparse coding hypothesis conjectures an optimal sensory coding approach where a neural population uses as few active units as possible to represent a stimulus. We demonstrate that a wide variety of {nCRF} effects are emergent properties of a single sparse coding model implemented in a neurally plausible network structure (requiring no parameter tuning to produce different effects). Specifically, we replicate a wide variety of {nCRF} electrophysiology experiments (e.g., end-stopping, surround suppression, contrast invariance of orientation tuning, cross-orientation suppression, etc.) on a dynamical system implementing sparse coding, showing that this model produces individual units that reproduce the canonical {nCRF} effects. Furthermore, when the population diversity of an {nCRF} effect has also been reported in the literature, we show that this model produces many of the same population characteristics. These results show that the sparse coding hypothesis, when coupled with a biophysically plausible implementation, can provide a unified high-level functional interpretation to many response properties that have generally been viewed through distinct mechanistic or phenomenological models. Simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) demonstrate many response properties that are either nonlinear or involve response modulations (i.e., stimuli that do not cause a response in isolation alter the cell's response to other stimuli). These non-classical receptive field ({nCRF}) effects are generally modeled individually and their collective role in biological vision is not well understood. Previous work has shown that classical receptive field ({CRF}) properties of V1 cells (i.e., the spatial structure of the visual field responsive to stimuli) could be explained by the sparse coding hypothesis, which is an optimal coding model that conjectures a neural population should use the fewest number of cells simultaneously to represent each stimulus. In this paper, we have performed extensive simulated physiology experiments to show that many {nCRF} response properties are simply emergent effects of a dynamical system implementing this same sparse coding model. These results suggest that rather than representing disparate information processing operations themselves, these {nCRF} effects could be consequences of an optimal sensory coding strategy that attempts to represent each stimulus most efficiently. This interpretation provides a potentially unifying high-level functional interpretation to many response properties that have generally been viewed through distinct models.},

                To behave adaptively, an organism must balance the accurate maintenance of information stored in working memory with the ability to update that information when the context changes. This trade-off between fidelity and flexibility may depend upon the anticipated likelihood that updating will be necessary. To address the neurobiological basis of anticipatory optimization, we acquired functional magnetic resonance imaging data, while healthy human subjects performed a modified delayed-response task. This task used cues that predicted memory updating, with high or low probability, followed by a contingent updating or maintenance event. This enabled us to compare behavior and neuronal activity during conditions in which updating was anticipated with high and low probability, and measure responses to expected and unexpected memory updating. Based on the known role of dopamine in cognitive flexibility and working memory updating, we hypothesized that differences in anticipatory set would be manifest in the dopaminergic midbrain and striatum. Consistent with our predictions, we identified sustained activation in the dopaminergic midbrain and the striatum, associated with anticipations of high versus low updating probability. We also found that this anticipatory factor affected neural responses to subsequent updating processes, which suppressed, rather than elevated, midbrain and striatal activity. Our study addresses for the first time an important and hitherto understudied aspect of working memory.

@article{Llinas91,
	Abstract = {
                Following a set of studies concerning the intrinsic electrophysiology of mammalian central neurons in relation to global brain function, we reach the following conclusions: (i) the main difference between wakefulness and paradoxical sleep lies in the weight given to sensory afferents in cognitive images; (ii) otherwise, wakefulness and paradoxical sleep are fundamentally equivalent brain states probably subserved by an intrinsic thalamo-cortical loop. From this assumption, we conclude that wakefulness is an intrinsic functional realm, modulated by sensory parameters. In support of this hypothesis, we review morphological studies of the thalamocortical system, which indicate that only a minor part of its connectivity is devoted to the transfer of direct sensory input. Rather, most of the connectivity is geared to the generation of internal functional modes, which may, in principle, operate in the presence or absence of sensory activation. These considerations lead us to challenge the traditional Jamesian view of brain function according to which consciousness is generated as an exclusive by-product of sensory input. Instead, we argue that consciousness is fundamentally a closed-loop property, in which the ability of cells to be intrinsically active plays a central role. We further discuss the importance of spatial and temporal mapping in the elaboration of cognitive and perceptual constructs.

@article{citeulike:12327248,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields ({RFs}) of neurons in primary visual cortex have traditionally been subdivided into two major classes:  '' simple'' and  '' complex'' cells. Simple cells were originally defined by the existence of segregated subregions within their {RF} that respond to either the on- or offset of a light bar and by spatial summation within each of these regions, whereas complex cells had {ON} and {OFF} regions that were coextensive in space [Hubel {DH}, et al. (1962) J Physiol 160:106--154]. Although other definitions based on the linearity of response modulation have been proposed later [Movshon {JA}, et al. (1978) J Physiol 283:53--77; Skottun {BC}, et al. (1991) Vision Res 31(7-8):1079--1086], the segregation of {ON} and {OFF} subregions has remained an important criterion for the distinction between simple and complex cells. Here we report that response profiles of neurons in primary auditory cortex of monkeys show a similar distinction: one group of cells has segregated {ON} and {OFF} subregions in frequency space; and another group shows {ON} and {OFF} responses within largely overlapping response profiles. This observation is intriguing for two reasons: (i) spectrotemporal dissociation in the auditory domain provides a basic neural mechanism for the segregation of sounds, a fundamental prerequisite for auditory figure-ground discrimination; and (ii) the existence of similar types of {RF} organization in visual and auditory cortex would support the existence of a common canonical processing algorithm within cortical columns.},

@article{Hohl13,
	Abstract = { The responses of single {MT} neurons predict trial-to-trial variation in eye movement The correlations imply that variation in pursuit initiation arises in sensory noise Noise reduction between {MT} and pursuit initiation is relatively small Sensory decoding normalizes with an uncorrelated estimate of {MT} population response We have used a new approach to study the neural decoding function that converts the population response in extrastriate area {MT} into estimates of target motion to drive smooth pursuit eye movement. Experiments reveal significant trial-by-trial correlations between the responses of {MT} neurons and the initiation of pursuit. The preponderance of significant correlations and the relatively low reduction in noise between {MT} and the behavioral output support the hypothesis of a sensory origin for at least some of the trial-by-trial variation in pursuit initiation. The finding of mainly positive {MT}-pursuit correlations, whether the target speed is faster or slower than the neuron's preferred speed, places strong constraints on the neural decoding computation. We propose that decoding is based on normalizing a weighted population vector of opponent motion responses; normalization comes from neurons uncorrelated with those used to compute the weighted population vector.},

	Abstract = {
                A recent probabilistic model unified findings on sequential generalization ("rule learning") via independently-motivated principles of generalization (Frank \& Tenenbaum, 2011). Endress critiques this work, arguing that learners do not prefer more specific hypotheses (a central assumption of the model), that "common-sense psychology" provides an adequate explanation of rule learning, and that Bayesian models imply incorrect optimality claims but can be fit to any pattern of data. Endress's response raises useful points about the importance of mechanistic explanation, but the specific critiques of our work are not supported. More broadly, I argue that Endress undervalues the importance of formal models. Although probabilistic models must meet a high standard to be used as evidence for optimality claims, they nevertheless provide a powerful framework for describing cognition.

	Abstract = {
                To a large extent, progress in neuroscience has been driven by the study of single-cell responses averaged over several repetitions of stimuli or behaviours. However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.

However, little is known regarding how these neurons encode high-order visual information in a systematic manner as a population. To address this issue, we have measured detailed spatial structures of classical center and suppressive surround regions of receptive fields of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons and examined how a population of such neurons allow encoding of various high-order features and shapes in visual scenes. Using a novel method to reconstruct structures, we found that the center and surround regions are often both elongated parallel to each other, reminiscent of on and off subregions of simple cells without surround suppression. These structures allow V1 neurons to extract high-order contours of various orientations and spatial frequencies, with a variety of optimal values across neurons. The results show that a wide range of orientations and widths of the high-order features are systematically represented by the population of V1 neurons with surround suppression.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a heuristic proof (and simulations of a primordial soup) suggesting that life---or biological self-organization---is an inevitable and emergent property of any (ergodic) random dynamical system that possesses a Markov blanket. This conclusion is based on the following arguments: if the coupling among an ensemble of dynamical systems is mediated by short-range forces, then the states of remote systems must be conditionally independent. These independencies induce a Markov blanket that separates internal and external states in a statistical sense. The existence of a Markov blanket means that internal states will appear to minimize a free energy functional of the states of their Markov blanket. Crucially, this is the same quantity that is optimized in Bayesian inference. Therefore, the internal states (and their blanket) will appear to engage in active Bayesian inference. In other words, they will appear to model---and act on---their world to preserve their functional and structural integrity, leading to homoeostasis and a simple form of autopoiesis.},

In this paper, we provide a detailed description of the simulation environment, its features, and an estimation of the performance. In addition, we present some results related to the simulation of highly connected large-scale neuronal networks focusing on the stimulus-evoked activity and the propagation of network activity. We found that the simulated results qualitatively fit experimental recordings obtained by recently developed high density multi-electrode transducers for in vitro applications. In this context, {NeuVision} can be utilized along with multi-site recordings to understand neural networks dynamics.},

	Abstract = {Visual experience can cause functional modification in the adult visual cortex; however, how cortical receptive fields ({RFs}) are dynamically modified by natural scene stimulation remains unclear. Here, using in vivo patch-clamp recordings from neurons in the rat primary visual cortex (V1), we showed that minutes of conditioning with natural movies could increase the similarity between cortical {RF} structure and the subset of movie images that depolarized the cell. This effect lasted for a few minutes in the absence of further movie stimulation. Manipulating the statistics of the movies by temporal shuffling or spatial whitening showed that the spatiotemporal correlation of the movie was important in inducing the {RF} modification. Furthermore, the movie-induced {RF} modification required the activation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. Such rapid {RF} modification may play an important role in the dynamic coding of natural scenes.},

@article{Bornschein13,
	Abstract = {Simple cells in primary visual cortex were famously found to respond to low-level image components such as edges. Sparse coding and independent component analysis ({ICA}) emerged as the standard computational models for simple cell coding because they linked their receptive fields to the statistics of visual stimuli. However, a salient feature of image statistics, occlusions of image components, is not considered by these models. Here we ask if occlusions have an effect on the predicted shapes of simple cell receptive fields. We use a comparative approach to answer this question and investigate two models for simple cells: a standard linear model and an occlusive model. For both models we simultaneously estimate optimal receptive fields, sparsity and stimulus noise. The two models are identical except for their component superposition assumption. We find the image encoding and receptive fields predicted by the models to differ significantly. While both models predict many Gabor-like fields, the occlusive model predicts a much sparser encoding and high percentages of 'globular' receptive fields. This relatively new center-surround type of simple cell response is observed since reverse correlation is used in experimental studies. While high percentages of 'globular' fields can be obtained using specific choices of sparsity and overcompleteness in linear sparse coding, no or only low proportions are reported in the vast majority of studies on linear models (including all {ICA} models). Likewise, for the here investigated linear model and optimal sparsity, only low proportions of 'globular' fields are observed. In comparison, the occlusive model robustly infers high proportions and can match the experimentally observed high proportions of 'globular' fields well. Our computational study, therefore, suggests that 'globular' fields may be evidence for an optimal encoding of visual occlusions in primary visual cortex. The statistics of our visual world is dominated by occlusions. Almost every image processed by our brain consists of mutually occluding objects, animals and plants. Our visual cortex is optimized through evolution and throughout our lifespan for such stimuli. Yet, the standard computational models of primary visual processing do not consider occlusions. In this study, we ask what effects visual occlusions may have on predicted response properties of simple cells which are the first cortical processing units for images. Our results suggest that recently observed differences between experiments and predictions of the standard simple cell models can be attributed to occlusions. The most significant consequence of occlusions is the prediction of many cells sensitive to center-surround stimuli. Experimentally, large quantities of such cells are observed since new techniques (reverse correlation) are used. Without occlusions, they are only obtained for specific settings and none of the seminal studies (sparse coding, {ICA}) predicted such fields. In contrast, the new type of response naturally emerges as soon as occlusions are considered. In comparison with recent in vivo experiments we find that occlusive models are consistent with the high percentages of center-surround simple cells observed in macaque monkeys, ferrets and mice.},

@article{Freeman13,
	Abstract = {
                There is no generally accepted account of the function of the second visual cortical area (V2), partly because no simple response properties robustly distinguish V2 neurons from those in primary visual cortex (V1). We constructed synthetic stimuli replicating the higher-order statistical dependencies found in natural texture images and used them to stimulate macaque V1 and V2 neurons. Most V2 cells responded more vigorously to these textures than to control stimuli lacking naturalistic structure; V1 cells did not. Functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) measurements in humans revealed differences between V1 and V2 that paralleled the neuronal measurements. The ability of human observers to detect naturalistic structure in different types of texture was well predicted by the strength of neuronal and {fMRI} responses in V2 but not in V1. Together, these results reveal a particular functional role for V2 in the representation of natural image structure.

@article{Constantinople13,
	Abstract = {For decades, neuroscientists have assumed that there is a  '' canonical microcircuit'' in the neo cortex, in which information is transformed as excitation spreads serially along connections from thalamus, to cortical layer 4, then to layers 2/3, to layers 5/6, and finally to other brain regions. Each cortical layer is thought to transform sensory signals to extract behaviorally relevant information. Now, Constantinople and Bruno (p. 1591) challenge this dogma. In vivo whole-cell recordings revealed that sensory stimuli activate neurons in deep cortical layers simultaneously to those in layer 4 and that a large number of thalamic neurons converge onto deep pyramidal neurons, possibly allowing sensory information to completely bypass upper layers. Temporary blockade of layer 4 revealed that synaptic input to deep cortical layers derived entirely from the thalamus and not at all from upper cortical layers. This thalamically derived synaptic input reliably drove pyramidal neurons in layer 5 to discharge action potentials in the living animal. These deep layer neurons project to numerous higher-order brain regions and could directly mediate behavior.},

	Abstract = {One of the major lessons of memory research has been that human memory is fallible, imprecise, and subject to interference. Thus, although observers can remember thousands of images, it is widely assumed that these memories lack detail. Contrary to this assumption, here we show that long-term memory is capable of storing a massive number of objects with details from the image. Participants viewed pictures of 2,500 objects over the course of 5.5 h. Afterward, they were shown pairs of images and indicated which of the two they had seen. The previously viewed item could be paired with either an object from a novel category, an object of the same basic-level category, or the same object in a different state or pose. Performance in each of these conditions was remarkably high (92\%, 88\%, and 87\%, respectively), suggesting that participants successfully maintained detailed representations of thousands of images. These results have implications for cognitive models, in which capacity limitations impose a primary computational constraint (e.g., models of object recognition), and pose a challenge to neural models of memory storage and retrieval, which must be able to account for such a large and detailed storage capacity.},

@article{Scholl13,
	Abstract = {Orientation selectivity is a property of mammalian primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, yet its emergence along the visual pathway varies across species. In carnivores and primates, elongated receptive fields first appear in V1, whereas in lagomorphs such receptive fields emerge earlier, in the retina. Here we examine the mouse visual pathway and reveal the existence of orientation selectivity in lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) relay cells. Cortical inactivation does not reduce this orientation selectivity, indicating that cortical feedback is not its source. Orientation selectivity is similar for {LGN} relay cells spiking and subthreshold input to V1 neurons, suggesting that cortical orientation selectivity is inherited from the {LGN} in mouse. In contrast, orientation selectivity of cat {LGN} relay cells is small relative to subthreshold inputs onto V1 simple cells. Together, these differences show that although orientation selectivity exists in visual neurons of both rodents and carnivores, its emergence along the visual pathway, and thus its underlying neuronal circuitry, is fundamentally different.},

@article{Shelley02,
	Abstract = {This paper reports on the consequences of large, activity dependent, synaptic conductances for neurons in a large-scale neuronal network model of the input layer {4Cα} of the Macaque primary visual cortex (Area V1). This high conductance state accounts for experimental observations about orientation selectivity, dynamics, and response magnitude (D. {McLaughlin} et al. (2000) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 97: 8087--8092), and the linear dependence of Simple cells on visual stimuli (J. Wielaard et al. (2001) J. Neuroscience 21: 5203--5211). The source of large conductances in the model can be traced to inhibitory corticocortical synapses, and the model's predictions of large conductance changes are consistent with recent intracellular measurements (L. {Borg-Graham} et al. (1998) Nature 393: 369--373; J. Hirsch et al. (1998) J. Neuroscience 15: 9517--9528; {J.S}. Anderson et al. (2000) J. Neurophysiol. 84: 909--926). During visual stimulation, these conductances are large enough that their associated time-scales become the shortest in the model cortex, even below that of synaptic interactions. One consequence of this activity driven separation of time-scales is that a neuron responds very quickly to temporal changes in its synaptic drive, with its intracellular membrane potential tracking closely an effective reversal potential composed of the instantaneous synaptic inputs. From the effective potential and large synaptic conductance, the spiking activity of a cell can be expressed in an interesting and simplified manner, with the result suggesting how accurate and smoothly graded responses are achieved in the model network. Further, since neurons in this high-conductance state respond quickly, they are also good candidates as coincidence detectors and burst transmitters.},

@article{Nowak03,
	Abstract = {
                To facilitate the characterization of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking ({RS}), fast spiking ({FS}), intrinsic bursting ({IB}), and chattering ({CH}). Each of these contained significant subclasses. {RS} neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. {FS} neurons had short-duration action potentials (<0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. {IB} neurons typically generated a low frequency (<425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, {CH} neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration (<0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses.

@article{Rauch03,
	Abstract = {In the intact brain neurons are constantly exposed to intense synaptic activity. This heavy barrage of excitatory and inhibitory inputs was recreated in vitro by injecting a noisy current, generated as an {Ornstein-Uhlenbeck} process, into the soma of rat neocortical pyramidal cells. The response to such in vivo-like currents was studied systematically by analyzing the time development of the instantaneous spike frequency, and when possible, the stationary mean spike frequency as a function of both the mean and the variance of the input current. All cells responded with an in vivo-like action potential activity with stationary statistics that could be sustained throughout long stimulation intervals (tens of seconds), provided the frequencies were not too high. The temporal evolution of the response revealed the presence of mechanisms of fast and slow spike frequency adaptation, and a medium duration mechanism of facilitation. For strong input currents, the slow adaptation mechanism made the spike frequency response nonstationary. The minimal frequencies that caused strong slow adaptation (a decrease in the spike rate by more than 1 Hz/s), were in the range 30-80 Hz and depended on the pipette solution used. The stationary response function has been fitted by two simple models of integrate-and-fire neurons endowed with a frequency-dependent modification of the input current. This accounts for all the fast and slow mechanisms of adaptation and facilitation that determine the stationary response, and proved necessary to fit the model to the experimental data. The coefficient of variability of the interspike interval was also in part captured by the model neurons, by tuning the parameters of the model to match the mean spike frequencies only. We conclude that the integrate-and-fire model with spike-frequency-dependent adaptation/facilitation is an adequate model reduction of cortical cells when the mean spike-frequency response to in vivo-like currents with stationary statistics is considered.},

	Abstract = {Wiring a brain presents a formidable problem because neural circuits require an enormous number of fast and durable connections. We propose that evolution was likely to have optimized neural circuits to minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of "wire" used to construct circuits, and to have maximized the density of synapses. Here we ask the question: "What fraction of the volume should be taken up by axons and dendrites (i.e., wire) when these variables are at their optimal values?" The biophysical properties of axons and dendrites dictate that wire should occupy 3/5 of the volume in an optimally wired gray matter. We have measured the fraction of the volume occupied by each cellular component and find that the volume of wire is close to the predicted optimal value.},

	Abstract = {
                1. We investigated cells in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) and the medial superior temporal area ({MST}) that discharged during smooth pursuit of a dim target in an otherwise dark room. For each of these pursuit cells we determined whether the response during pursuit originated from visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target or from an extraretinal input related to the pursuit movement itself. We distinguished between these alternatives by removing the visual motion stimulus during pursuit either by blinking off the visual target briefly or by stabilizing the target on the retina. 2. In the foveal representation of {MT} ({MTf}), we found that pursuit cells usually decreased their rate of discharge during a blink or during stabilization of the visual target. The pursuit response of these cells depends on visual stimulation of the retina by the pursuit target. 3. In a dorsal-medial region of {MST} ({MSTd}), cells continued to respond during pursuit despite a blink or stabilization of the pursuit target. The pursuit response of these cells is dependent on an extraretinal input. 4. In a lateral-anterior region of {MST} ({MST1}), we found both types of pursuit cells; some, like those in {MTf}, were dependent on visual inputs whereas others, like those in {MSTd}, received an extraretinal input. 5. We observed a relationship between pursuit responses and passive visual responses. {MST} cells whose pursuit responses were attributable to extraretinal inputs tended to respond preferentially to large-field random-dot patterns. Some cells that preferred small spots also had an extraretinal input. 6. For 92\% of the pursuit cells we studied, the pursuit response began after onset of the pursuit eye movement. A visual response preceding onset of the eye movement could be observed in many of these cells if the initial motion of the target occurred within the visual receptive field of the cell and in its preferred direction. In contrast to the pursuit response, however, this visual response was not dependent on execution of the pursuit movement. 7. For the remaining 8\% of the pursuit cells, the pursuit discharge began before initiation of the pursuit eye movement. This occurred even though the initial motion of the target was outside the receptive field as mapped during fixation trials. Our data suggest, however, that such responses may be attributable to an expansion of the receptive field that accompanies enhanced visual {responses.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})

Despite the computational advantages to sparsely firing populations, experimental data defining the fraction of responsive neurons and the range of firing rates have not been synthesized. Here we review data about the distribution of activity across neuronal populations in primary sensory cortex. Overall, the firing output of granular and infragranular layers is highest. Although subthreshold activity across supragranular neurons is decidedly non-sparse, spikes are much less frequent and some cells are silent. Superficial layers of the cortex may employ specific cell and circuit mechanisms to increase sparseness.},

@article{Nuding08,
	Abstract = {The smooth pursuit eye movement (SPEM) system is much more sensitive to target motion perturbations during pursuit than during fixation. This sensitivity is commonly attributed to a dynamic gain control mechanism. Neither the neural substrate nor the functional architecture for this gain control has been fully revealed. There are at least two cortical areas that crucially contribute to smooth pursuit and are therefore eligible sites for dynamic gain control: the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the pursuit area of the frontal eye fields (FEFs), which both project to brain stem premotor structures via parallel pathways. The aim of this study was to develop a model of smooth pursuit based on behavioral, anatomical, and neurophysiological results to account for nonlinear dynamic gain control. Using a behavioral paradigm in humans consisting of a sinusoidal oscillation (4 Hz, {+/-}8{degrees}/s) superimposed on a constant velocity target motion (0-24{degrees}/s), we were able to identify relevant gain control parameters in the model. A salient feature of our model is the emergence of two parallel pathways from higher visual cortical to lower motor areas in the brain stem that correspond to the MST and FEF pathways. Detailed analysis of the model revealed that one pathway mainly carries eye velocity related signals, whereas the other is associated mostly with eye acceleration. From comparison with known neurophysiological results we conclude that the dynamic gain control can be attributed to the FEF pathway, whereas the MST pathway serves as the basic circuit for maintaining an ongoing SPEM.},

	Abstract = {Intercepting momentarily invisible moving objects requires internally generated estimations of target trajectory. We demonstrate here that the parabigeminal nucleus ({PBN}) encodes such estimations, combining sensory representations of target location, extrapolated positions of briefly obscured targets, and eye position information. Cui and Malpeli (Cui H, Malpeli {JG}. J Neurophysiol 89: 3128--3142, 2003) reported that {PBN} activity for continuously visible tracked targets is determined by retinotopic target position. Here we show that when cats tracked moving, blinking targets the relationship between activity and target position was similar for {ON} and {OFF} phases (400 ms for each phase). The dynamic range of activity evoked by virtual targets was 94\% of that of real targets for the first 200 ms after target offset and 64\% for the next 200 ms. Activity peaked at about the same best target position for both real and virtual targets. {PBN} encoding of target position takes into account changes in eye position resulting from saccades, even without visual feedback. Since {PBN} response fields are retinotopically organized, our results suggest that activity foci associated with real and virtual targets at a given target position lie in the same physical location in the {PBN}, i.e., a retinotopic as well as a rate encoding of virtual-target position. We also confirm that {PBN} activity is specific to the intended target of a saccade and is predictive of which target will be chosen if two are offered. A Bayesian predictor-corrector model is presented that conceptually explains the differences in the dynamic ranges of {PBN} neuronal activity evoked during tracking of real and virtual targets.},

	Abstract = {Firing-rate models provide a practical tool for studying signal processing in the early visual system, permitting more thorough mathematical analysis than spike-based models. We show here that essential response properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) can be captured by surprisingly simple firing-rate models consisting of a low-pass filter and a nonlinear activation function. The starting point for our analysis are two spiking neuron models based on experimental data: a spike-response model fitted to data from macaque (Carandini et al. J. Vis., 20(14), 1--2011, 2007), and a model with conductance-based synapses and afterhyperpolarizing currents fitted to data from cat (Casti et al. J. Comput. Neurosci., 24(2), 235--252, 2008). We obtained the nonlinear activation function by stimulating the model neurons with stationary stochastic spike trains, while we characterized the linear filter by fitting a low-pass filter to responses to sinusoidally modulated stochastic spike trains. To account for the {non-Poisson} nature of retinal spike trains, we performed all analyses with spike trains with higher-order gamma statistics in addition to Poissonian spike trains. Interestingly, the properties of the low-pass filter depend only on the average input rate, but not on the modulation depth of sinusoidally modulated input. Thus, the response properties of our model are fully specified by just three parameters (low-frequency gain, cutoff frequency, and delay) for a given mean input rate and input regularity. This simple firing-rate model reproduces the response of spiking neurons to a step in input rate very well for Poissonian as well as for {non-Poissonian} input. We also found that the cutoff frequencies, and thus the filter time constants, of the rate-based model are unrelated to the membrane time constants of the underlying spiking models, in agreement with similar observations for simpler models.},

	Abstract = {
                Free-energy based reinforcement learning ({FERL}) was proposed for learning in high-dimensional state- and action spaces, which cannot be handled by standard function approximation methods. In this study, we propose a scaled version of free-energy based reinforcement learning to achieve more robust and more efficient learning performance. The action-value function is approximated by the negative free-energy of a restricted Boltzmann machine, divided by a constant scaling factor that is related to the size of the Boltzmann machine (the square root of the number of state nodes in this study). Our first task is a digit floor gridworld task, where the states are represented by images of handwritten digits from the {MNIST} data set. The purpose of the task is to investigate the proposed method's ability, through the extraction of task-relevant features in the hidden layer, to cluster images of the same digit and to cluster images of different digits that corresponds to states with the same optimal action. We also test the method's robustness with respect to different exploration schedules, i.e., different settings of the initial temperature and the temperature discount rate in softmax action selection. Our second task is a robot visual navigation task, where the robot can learn its position by the different colors of the lower part of four landmarks and it can infer the correct corner goal area by the color of the upper part of the landmarks. The state space consists of binarized camera images with, at most, nine different colors, which is equal to 6642 binary states. For both tasks, the learning performance is compared with standard {FERL} and with function approximation where the action-value function is approximated by a two-layered feedforward neural network.

	Abstract = {This paper describes a free energy principle that tries to explain the ability of biological systems to resist a natural tendency to disorder. It appeals to circular causality of the sort found in synergetic formulations of self-organization (e.g., the slaving principle) and models of coupled dynamical systems, using nonlinear Fokker Planck equations. Here, circular causality is induced by separating the states of a random dynamical system into external and internal states, where external states are subject to random fluctuations and internal states are not. This reduces the problem to finding some (deterministic) dynamics of the internal states that ensure the system visits a limited number of external states; in other words, the measure of its (random) attracting set, or the Shannon entropy of the external states is small. We motivate a solution using a principle of least action based on variational free energy (from statistical physics) and establish the conditions under which it is formally equivalent to the information bottleneck method. This approach has proved useful in understanding the functional architecture of the brain. The generality of variational free energy minimisation and corresponding information theoretic formulations may speak to interesting applications beyond the neurosciences; e.g., in molecular or evolutionary biology.},

	Abstract = {
                No pain, no gain: cost-benefit trade-off has been formalized in classical decision theory to account for how we choose whether to engage effort. However, how the brain decides when to have breaks in the course of effort production remains poorly understood. We propose that decisions to cease and resume work are triggered by a cost evidence accumulation signal reaching upper and lower bounds, respectively. We developed a task in which participants are free to exert a physical effort knowing that their payoff would be proportional to their effort duration. Functional {MRI} and magnetoencephalography recordings conjointly revealed that the theoretical cost evidence accumulation signal was expressed in proprioceptive regions (bilateral posterior insula). Furthermore, the slopes and bounds of the accumulation process were adapted to the difficulty of the task and the money at stake. Cost evidence accumulation might therefore provide a dynamical mechanistic account of how the human brain maximizes benefits while preventing exhaustion.

	Abstract = {
                In this paper, we pursue recent observations that, through selective dendritic filtering, single neurons respond to specific sequences of presynaptic inputs. We try to provide a principled and mechanistic account of this selectivity by applying a recent free-energy principle to a dendrite that is immersed in its neuropil or environment. We assume that neurons self-organize to minimize a variational free-energy bound on the self-information or surprise of presynaptic inputs that are sampled. We model this as a selective pruning of dendritic spines that are expressed on a dendritic branch. This pruning occurs when postsynaptic gain falls below a threshold. Crucially, postsynaptic gain is itself optimized with respect to free energy. Pruning suppresses free energy as the dendrite selects presynaptic signals that conform to its expectations, specified by a generative model implicit in its intracellular kinetics. Not only does this provide a principled account of how neurons organize and selectively sample the myriad of potential presynaptic inputs they are exposed to, but it also connects the optimization of elemental neuronal (dendritic) processing to generic (surprise or evidence-based) schemes in statistics and machine learning, such as Bayesian model selection and automatic relevance determination.

Consequently, neurons responding to visual motion in a direction-selective way are found in almost all species that see. However, directional information is not explicitly encoded at the level of a single photoreceptor. Rather, it has to be computed from the spatio-temporal excitation level of at least two photoreceptors. How this computation is done and how this computation is implemented in terms of neural circuitry and membrane biophysics have remained the focus of intense research over many decades.

@article{Joffily13,
	Abstract = {The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified Bayesian account of perception, learning and action. Despite the inextricable link between emotion and cognition, emotion has not yet been formulated under this framework. A core concept that permeates many perspectives on emotion is valence, which broadly refers to the positive and negative character of emotion or some of its aspects. In the present paper, we propose a definition of emotional valence in terms of the negative rate of change of free-energy over time. If the second time-derivative of free-energy is taken into account, the dynamics of basic forms of emotion such as happiness, unhappiness, hope, fear, disappointment and relief can be explained. In this formulation, an important function of emotional valence turns out to regulate the learning rate of the causes of sensory inputs. When sensations increasingly violate the agent's expectations, valence is negative and increases the learning rate. Conversely, when sensations increasingly fulfil the agent's expectations, valence is positive and decreases the learning rate. This dynamic interaction between emotional valence and learning rate highlights the crucial role played by emotions in biological agents' adaptation to unexpected changes in their world. Emotion plays a crucial role in the adaptation of humans and other animals to changes in their world. Nevertheless, emotion has been neglected in Bayesian models of learning in non-stationary environments. The free-energy principle has recently been proposed as a unified account of learning, perception and action in biological agents. In this paper, we propose a formal definition of emotional valence (i.e., the positive and negative character of emotion) in terms of the rate of change of free-energy or, under some simplifying assumptions, of prediction error over time. This formalization leads to a straightforward and simple meta-learning scheme that accounts for the complex and reciprocal interaction between cognition and emotion. We instantiate this scheme with an emotional agent who is able to dynamically assign emotional valence to every new state of the world that is visited and to experience basic forms of emotion. Crucially, our hypothetical agent uses emotional valence to dynamically adapt to unexpected changes in the world. The proposed scheme is very general in the sense that it is not tied to any particular generative model of sensory inputs.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe a general variational Bayesian approach for approximate inference on nonlinear stochastic dynamic models. This scheme extends established approximate inference on hidden-states to cover: (i) nonlinear evolution and observation functions, (ii) unknown parameters and (precision) hyperparameters and (iii) model comparison and prediction under uncertainty. Model identification or inversion entails the estimation of the marginal likelihood or evidence of a model. This difficult integration problem can be finessed by optimising a free-energy bound on the evidence using results from variational calculus. This yields a deterministic update scheme that optimises an approximation to the posterior density on the unknown model variables. We derive such a variational Bayesian scheme in the context of nonlinear stochastic dynamic hierarchical models, for both model identification and time-series prediction. The computational complexity of the scheme is comparable to that of an extended Kalman filter, which is critical when inverting high dimensional models or long time-series. Using {Monte-Carlo} simulations, we assess the estimation efficiency of this variational Bayesian approach using three stochastic variants of chaotic dynamic systems. We also demonstrate the model comparison capabilities of the method, its self-consistency and its predictive power.},

	Abstract = {A recent challenge to the completeness of some influential models of local-motion detection has come from experiments in which subjects had to detect a single dot moving along a trajectory amidst noise dots undergoing Brownian motion. We propose and test a new theory of the detection and measurement of visual motion, which can account for these \\{signal-in-Brownian\\}-noise experiments. The theory postulates that the signals from local-motion detectors are made coherent in space and time by a special purpose network, and that this coherence boosts signals of features moving along non-random trajectories over time. Two experiments were performed to estimate parameters and test the theory. These experiments showed that detection is impaired with increasing eccentricity, an effect that varies inversely with step size. They also showed that detection improves over durations extending to at least 600 msec. An implementation of the theory accounts for these psychophysical detection measurements.},

Here we numerically studied the activity dynamics of the resulting heterogeneous layered network of spiking integrate-and-fire neurons, connected with conductance-based synapses. The layered network exhibited, among other states, an interesting asynchronous activity with intermittent population-wide synchronizations. These population bursts ({PB}) were initiated by a network hot spot, and then spread into the other parts of the network. The cause of this {PB} is the correlation amplifying nature of recurrent connections, which becomes significant in densely coupled networks. The hot spot was located in layer 2/3, the part of the network with the highest number of excitatory recurrent connections. We conclude that in structured networks, regions with a high degree of recurrence and many out-going fibres may be a source for population-wide synchronization.},

@article{Bogadhi11a,
	Abstract = {Due to the aperture problem, the initial direction of tracking responses to a translating tilted bar is biased towards the direction orthogonal to the orientation of the bar. This directional error is largely reduced over the first 200 ms of tracking, consistent with the neural solution of the aperture problem (Pack \& Born, 2001) and is fully corrected during the steady-state. We have proposed that pursuit dynamics reflects that of visual motion processing and can be modeled as a dynamical Bayesian inference of {2D} target motion (Bogadhi et al., 2010). Such simple paradigm also offers a powerful way to explore interactions between sensory and predictive signals in controlling action (Montagnini et al., 2006). We conducted two experiments to investigate these interactions by transiently blanking the target at different moments of pursuit. First, a 45$\,^{\circ}$ or 135$\,^{\circ}$ tilted bar translating horizontally was blanked for four different durations (0, 200, 400 and 800 ms) during steady-state tracking. Bar orientation after reappearance changed on half of the trials. We found a marginal directional bias (compared to initial bias) when the target reappeared with no change of orientation and when target changed orientation with no transient blanking. However, there was a significant directional bias when the target reappeared with a change in orientation. Second, the target (an upright or a 45$\,^{\circ}$ tilted line) was blanked (duration: 200 ms) on half of the trials during the initiation phase of pursuit, starting at either 100 or 180 ms after pursuit onset. Line orientation was constant. We found a significant directional bias (i.e. equal to the initial bias) when 45$\,^{\circ}$ tilted line reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 100 ms. Such bias was marginal when the target reappeared after a 200 ms blank starting at 180 ms. These results suggest for a conditionally weighted mixing of retinal and extra retina signals in driving smooth pursuit.},

                Eye tracking dysfunction ({ETD}) has been found in large numbers of schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. Because of the many replications of the central findings, {ETD} has been proposed as a useful way of expanding the schizophrenia phenotype in genetic studies. We critically review the literature on {ETD} with respect to issues of measurement and the search for quantitative indices of {ETD}; syndrome and familial specificity of {ETD} for schizophrenia; statistical, interpretive, and methodological considerations in the use of mixture analysis; the association of {ETD} with clinically and psychometrically defined schizotypy; and the questions of trait stability and medication effects.

                Humans can overcome the 150 ms time delay of the smooth pursuit eye movement system and track smoothly moving visual targets with zero-latency. Our target-selective adaptive control model can also overcome an inherent time delay and produce zero-latency tracking. No other model or man-made system can do this. Our model is physically realizable and physiologically realistic. The technique used in our model should be useful for analyzing other time-delay systems, such as man-machine systems and robots.

	Abstract = {The Bayesian framework for machine learning allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge in a coherent way, avoids overfitting problems, and provides a principled basis for selecting between alternative models. Unfortunately the computations required are usually intractable. This thesis presents a unified variational Bayesian ({VB}) framework which approximates these computations in models with latent variables using a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. Chapter 1 presents background material on Bayesian inference, graphical models, and propaga-tion algorithms. Chapter 2 forms the theoretical core of the thesis, generalising the expectation-maximisation ({EM}) algorithm for learning maximum likelihood parameters to the {VB} {EM} al-gorithm which integrates over model parameters. The algorithm is then specialised to the large family of conjugate-exponential ({CE}) graphical models, and several theorems are presented to pave the road for automated {VB} derivation procedures in both directed and undirected graphs (Bayesian and Markov networks, respectively). Chapters 3-5 derive and apply the {VB} {EM} algorithm to three commonly-used and important models: mixtures of factor analysers, linear dynamical systems, and hidden Markov models.},

@article{Grossberg97,
	Abstract = {
                How does the saccadic movement system select a target when visual, auditory, and planned movement commands differ? How do retinal, head-centered, and motor error coordinates interact during the selection process? Recent data on superior colliculus ({SC}) reveal a spreading wave of activation across buildup cells the peak activity of which covaries with the current gaze error. In contrast, the locus of peak activity remains constant at burst cells, whereas their activity level decays with residual gaze error. A neural model answers these questions and simulates burst and buildup responses in visual, overlap, memory, and gap tasks. The model also simulates data on multimodal enhancement and suppression of activity in the deeper {SC} layers and suggests a functional role for {NMDA} receptors in this region. In particular, the model suggests how auditory and planned saccadic target positions become aligned and compete with visually reactive target positions to select a movement command. For this to occur, a transformation between auditory and planned head-centered representations and a retinotopic target representation is learned. Burst cells in the model generate teaching signals to the spreading wave layer. Spreading waves are produced by corollary discharges that render planned and visually reactive targets dimensionally consistent and enable them to compete for attention to generate a movement command in motor error coordinates. The attentional selection process also helps to stabilize the map-learning process. The model functionally interprets cells in the superior colliculus, frontal eye field, parietal cortex, mesencephalic reticular formation, paramedian pontine reticular formation, and substantia nigra pars reticulata.

@article{Lisberger99,
	Abstract = {We asked whether the dynamics of target motion are represented in visual area {MT} and how information about image velocity and acceleration might be extracted from the population responses in area {MT} for use in motor control. The time course of {MT} neuron responses was recorded in anesthetized macaque monkeys during target motions that covered the range of dynamics normally seen during smooth pursuit eye movements. When the target motion provided steps of target speed, {MT} neurons showed a continuum from purely tonic responses to those with large transient pulses of firing at the onset of motion. Cells with large transient responses for steps of target speed also had larger responses for smooth accelerations than for decelerations through the same range of target speeds. Condition-test experiments with pairs of 64 msec pulses of target speed revealed response attenuation at short interpulse intervals in cells with large transient responses. For sinusoidal modulation of target speed, {MT} neuron responses were strongly modulated for frequencies up to, but not higher than, 8 Hz. The phase of the responses was consistent with a 90 msec time delay between target velocity and firing rate. We created a model that reproduced the dynamic responses of {MT} cells using divisive gain control, used the model to visualize the population response in {MT} to individual stimuli, and devised weighted-averaging computations to reconstruct target speed and acceleration from the population response. Target speed could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to its preferred speed. Target acceleration could be reconstructed if each neuron's output was weighted according to the product of preferred speed and a measure of the size of its transient response.},

Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference---paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

@article{Collins09,
	Abstract = {In motor control, prediction of future events is vital for overcoming sensory-motor processing delays and facilitating rapid and accurate responses in a dynamic environment. In human ocular pursuit this is so pervasive that prediction of future target motion cannot easily be eliminated by randomizing stimulus parameters. We investigated the prediction of temporally randomized events during pursuit of alternating constant-velocity (ramp) stimuli in which the timing of direction changes varied unpredictably over a given range. Responses were not reactive; instead, smooth eye velocity began to decelerate in anticipation of each target reversal. In the first experiment, using a continuous-motion stimulus, we found that the time at which this occurred was relatively constant regardless of ramp duration, but increased as mean ramp duration of the range increased. Regression analysis revealed a quantitative association between deceleration timing and the previous two or three ramp durations in a trial, suggesting that recent stimulus history was used to create a running average of anticipatory timing. In the second experiment, we used discrete motion stimuli, with intervening periods of fixation, which allowed both target velocity and reversal timing to be varied, thereby decoupling ramp duration and displacement. This enabled us to confirm that the timing of anticipatory deceleration was based on the history of timing, rather than displacement, within the stimulus. We conclude that this strategy is used to minimize error amid temporal uncertainty, while simultaneously overcoming inherent delays in visuomotor processing.},

@article{Barnes02,
	Abstract = {It has been established that repeated presentation of a transient target motion stimulus such as a constant-velocity ramp leads to the build up of steady state ({SS}), anticipatory smooth pursuit eye movements after two or three presentations. Each {SS} response is then composed of the anticipatory component of nonvisual origin, a visual component associated with the stimulus presentation and another nonvisual component that represents the decay of the response after extinction of the stimulus. Here we investigated the interactions that occur when each motion stimulus was itself a sequence containing more than one ramp component. Ramp components had a velocity of 15 degrees /s or 30 degrees /s to left or right and were separated by gaps of 200 ms duration. In an initial experiment, responses to 2-ramp stimuli were examined and compared with responses to the single-ramp stimuli from which they were constituted. We present evidence that the anticipatory, nonvisual components of the double-ramp response result from the linear summation of the nonvisual components of the responses to the constituent single-ramp components. In a 2nd experiment, we examined responses to a wide variety of 4-ramp sequences and again found evidence that, in the {SS}, the responses were formed from the linear summation of the constituent single-ramp components. Regression analysis performed on the velocity at onset of each ramp component indicated that this nonvisual part of the response was predictive of the upcoming ramp component. To confirm this, unexpected changes were introduced into single ramp components of the 4-ramp sequence after at least five prior presentations of the sequence had allowed a {SS} response to be established. Subjects continued to initiate a response to the modified component that was appropriate in velocity and direction for the corresponding part of the previous sequence and inappropriate for the newly modified stimulus. This preprogrammed response persisted unmodified for more than 170 ms after onset of the modified ramp component. In contrast, in the second presentation of the new sequence, the anticipatory component of the response was highly correlated with the {SS} response of the new sequence, but not with that of the prior sequence, showing that the preprogrammed response had been modified very rapidly. Similar behaviour was observed whichever of the 4-ramp components was modified, indicating that the velocity and direction of the anticipatory response to each component had been preprogrammed. The results suggest that velocity information related to at least four elements of a sequence can be temporarily stored and subsequently released with appropriate temporal order to form an anticipatory response throughout the whole sequence.},

	Abstract = {Subjects made smooth pursuit eye movements with a target moving horizontally at 15 deg/sec. At a specified location the target either: (1) suddenly vanished; or (2) jumped to the fovea with target retinal velocity and feedback becoming 0 (target stabilized at the fovea). In each type of trial, the subjects either: "looked" at the target, "pushed" the target, or "passively" gazed. When the target vanished, eye velocity decreased exponentially with a short time-constant (tau approximately 0.10 sec), regardless of whether the subjects were "looking," "pushing" or "passively" gazing. However, some subjects while "pushing" (using an imaginary target) did generate low velocity smooth movement (1-2.5 deg/sec) late in the offset. When the target was stabilized at the fovea, eye velocity also decreased, but with a relatively long time-constant (tau = 0.4-0.8 sec). The time-constant was the same with both "looking," and "pushing", but was shorter for some subjects with "passive" gazing (tau = 0.1-0.5 sec). These findings show that smooth pursuit offset is influenced by the presence of a target, but is relatively independent of attentional mode. All of the pursuit offset responses can be simulated using a model of the pursuit system with target velocity and position inputs, and an internal positive feedback loop enabled by target presence.},

@article{Thaker99,
	Abstract = {
                In order to understand mechanisms underlying the smooth pursuit abnormality(ies) in schizophrenia, new methods, which independently evaluated predictive smooth pursuit responses to extra-retinal motion signals, were developed and tested. The study compared responses to only extra-retinal motion signals in normal volunteers (n = 25), and individuals with a chronic (n = 21) and a recent onset (n = 18) schizophrenia. Subject groups with chronic schizophrenia and recent onset schizophrenia had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects in response to only extra-retinal motion signals. The poor predictive pursuit was evident even at low target velocity when the closed-loop pursuit gain was normal in patients with schizophrenia. Ten of the 18 recent onset patients were drug-free at the time of testing and had no or minimum previous exposure to anti-psychotic medications. Re-analyses of the data showed that on most measures of predictive pursuit, drug-free patients were not significantly different from patients who received anti-psychotic drug treatment. Both patient groups had significantly poorer predictive pursuit than normal subjects. These results suggest that a deficit in processing extra-retinal motion may underlie the abnormal smooth pursuit response in schizophrenia. At low target velocities, patients with schizophrenia were able to compensate for the low extra-retinal gain by increasing the gain of response to the retinal slip velocity. This indicates that patients were able to process retinal slip velocity and generate smooth pursuit eye movements, but experienced a specific deficit in processing and/or integrating extra-retinal motion information for the smooth pursuit response.

	Abstract = {
                Oculomotor abnormality is one of the endophenotypes in schizophrenia. The predictive component of smooth pursuit can be studied by comparing the gain, i.e., the ratio of smooth eye position to target position, during predictable (pure sinusoidal) and unpredictable (pseudorandom) target motions. The aim of this experiment was to study predictive and nonpredictive components of smooth pursuit in two groups of schizophrenia patients compared with control subjects.
                Fifty-one schizophrenia patients (40 nondeficit and 11 deficit) and 21 control subjects were studied. During a predictable task, subjects were asked to track a sinusoidal target (.4 Hz). For the unpredictable task, the pseudorandom target motion consisted of five superimposed sinusoidal waveforms (.1, .2, .4, .6, and .8 Hz). The smooth eye position (eye position without saccades), gain, and phase were calculated for each frequency in each participant and for both tasks.
                The mean sinusoidal smooth eye position gain was significantly lower in patients than in control subjects with no significant difference between deficit and nondeficit patients. During the pseudorandom task, all groups had a similar gain at .4 Hz.
                Our study reveals that patients have a normal nonpredictive component of smooth pursuit, regardless of their level of negative symptoms. In contrast, the predictive mechanisms involved in eye pursuit were impaired in schizophrenia patients. These results indicate that poor pursuit performance during smooth pursuit is primarily a consequence of a predictive problem and is not related to the ability to generate an accurate pursuit maintenance response.

                Subjects regarded targets which executed step-ramp motion in one of two conditions, either active (looking at the target) or passive (similar to the subject condition in passive or stare optokinetic nystagmus). The targets jumped 2 deg to one side and returned at a constant velocity. Targets were single round targets or extended targets with a high edge content. Many subjects showed substantial smooth eye movement responses in the passive condition, suggesting that a substantial component of initial smooth movement responses can occur independent of attention. Additional features of the smooth eye movement responses included (i) oculomotor "twitches" (brief, short-latency smooth eye movements in the step direction), (ii) overshoots (eye velocity greater than target velocity), and (iii) oscillations. Most of the response features can be accounted for by a model with a gain that is dependent on the subject's attentional level and on stimulus parameters.

	Abstract = {This study investigates the effect of gap junctions on firing propagation in a feedforward neural network by a numerical simulation with biologically plausible parameters. Gap junctions are electrical couplings between two cells connected by a binding protein, connexin. Recent electrophysiological studies have reported that a large number of inhibitory neurons in the mammalian cortex are mutually connected by gap junctions, and synchronization of gap junctions, spread over several hundred microns, suggests that these have a strong effect on the dynamics of the cortical network. However, the effect of gap junctions on firing propagation in cortical circuits has not been examined systematically. In this study, we perform numerical simulations using biologically plausible parameters to clarify this effect on population firing in a feedforward neural network. The results suggest that gap junctions switch the temporally uniform firing in a layer to temporally clustered firing in subsequent layers, resulting in an enhancement in the propagation of population firing in the feedforward network. Because gap junctions are often modulated in physiological conditions, we speculate that gap junctions could be related to a gating function of population firing in the brain.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic activity of glia has repeatedly been demonstrated, but if such activity is independent from neuronal activity, glia would not have any role in the information processing in the brain or in the generation of animal behavior. Evidence for neurons communicating with glia is solid, but the signaling pathway leading back from glial-to-neuronal activity was often difficult to study. Here, we introduced a transgenic mouse line in which channelrhodopsin-2, a light-gated cation channel, was expressed in astrocytes. Selective photostimulation of these astrocytes in vivo triggered neuronal activation. Using slice preparations, we show that glial photostimulation leads to release of glutamate, which was sufficient to activate {AMPA} receptors on Purkinje cells and to induce long-term depression of parallel {fiber-to-Purkinje} cell synapses through activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. In contrast to neuronal synaptic vesicular release, glial activation likely causes preferential activation of extrasynaptic receptors that appose glial membrane. Finally, we show that neuronal activation by glial stimulation can lead to perturbation of cerebellar modulated motor behavior. These findings demonstrate that glia can modulate the tone of neuronal activity and behavior. This animal model is expected to be a potentially powerful approach to study the role of glia in brain function.},

	Abstract = {Single cortical neurons in the mammalian brain receive signals arising from multiple sensory input channels. Dendritic integration of these afferent signals is critical in determining the amplitude and time course of the neurons' output signals. As of yet, little is known about the spatial and temporal organization of converging sensory inputs. Here, we combined in vivo two-photon imaging with whole-cell recordings in layer 2 neurons of the mouse vibrissal cortex as a means to analyze the spatial pattern of subthreshold dendritic calcium signals evoked by the stimulation of different whiskers. We show that the principle whisker and the surrounding whiskers can evoke dendritic calcium transients in the same neuron. Distance-dependent attenuation of dendritic calcium transients and the corresponding subthreshold depolarization suggest feed-forward activation. We found that stimulation of different whiskers produced multiple calcium hotspots on the same dendrite. Individual hotspots were activated with low probability in a stochastic manner. We show that these hotspots are generated by calcium signals arising in dendritic spines. Some spines were activated uniquely by single whiskers, but many spines were activated by multiple whiskers. These shared spines indicate the existence of presynaptic feeder neurons that integrate and transmit activity arising from multiple whiskers. Despite the dendritic overlap of whisker-specific and shared inputs, different whiskers are represented by a unique set of activation patterns within the dendritic field of each neuron.},

To this end, {NeuralEnsemble} hosts services for source code management and bug tracking ({Subversion/Trac}) for a number of open-source neuroscience tools, organizes an annual workshop devoted to collaborative software development in neuroscience, and manages a google-group discussion forum. Here, we present two {NeuralEnsemble} hosted projects: {PyNN} ({http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN}) is a package for simulator-independent specification of neuronal network models. You can write the code for a model once, using the {PyNN} {API}, and then run it without modification on any simulator that {PyNN} supports. Currently {NEURON}, {NEST}, {PCSIM} and a {VLSI} hardware implementation are fully supported. {NeuroTools} ({http://neuralensemble.org/NeuroTools}) is a set of tools to manage, store and analyse computational neuroscience simulations. It has been designed around {PyNN}, but can also be used for data from other simulation environments or even electrophysiological measurements. We will illustrate how the use of {PyNN} and {NeuroTools} ease the developmental process of models in computational neuroscience, enhancing collaboration between different groups and increasing the confidence in correctness of results. {NeuralEnsemble} efforts are supported by the European {FACETS} project ({EU}-{IST}-2005-15879)},

	Abstract = {Most studies of cortical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings [1], focussing on a rather local scale. Neuronal connections in the cortex, however, show a more complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range patchy connections [2,3] as shown in the figure: It represents a tracer injection (gray areas) in the {GM} of a flattened cortex (top view): Black dots indicate neuron positions, blue lines their patchy axonal ramifications, and red lines represent the local connections. Moreover, to include distant synapses, one has to enlarge the spatial scale from the typically assumed 1mm to 5mm side length. As it is our aim to analyze more realistic network models of the cortex we assume a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometry of dendritesand axons [3]. Here, we ask to what extent the assumption of specific geometric traits influences the resulting dynamical behavior of these networks. Analyzing various characteristic measures that describe spiking neurons (e.g., coefficient of variation, correlation coefficient), we compare the dynamical state spaces of different connectivity types: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. On top of biologically realistic background states, a stimulus is applied in order to analyze their stabilities. As previous studies [1], we also find different dynamical states depending on the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic weights. Preliminary results indicate, however, that transitions between these states are much sharper in case of local or patchy couplings. This work is supported by {EU} Grant 15879 ({FACETS}).

	Abstract = {Most studies of cor tical network dynamics are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood cou- plings, e.g., [Kumar, Schrader, Aer tsen, Rotter, 2008, Neural Computation 20, 1--43]. Neuronal connections in the cor tex, however, show a complex spatial pattern composed of local and long-range connections, the latter featuring a so-called patchy projection pattern, i.e., spatially clustered synapses [Binzegger, Douglas, Martin, 2007, J. Neurosci. 27(45), 12242--12254]. The idea of our project is to provide and to analyze probabilistic network models that more adequately represent horizontal connectivity in the cor tex. In par- ticular, we investigate the effect of specific projection patterns on the dynamical state space of cor tical networks. Assuming an enlarged spatial scale we employ a distance dependent connectivity that reflects the geometr y of dendrites and axons. We simulate the network dynamics using a neuronal network simula- tor {NEST}/{PyNN}. Our models are composed of conductance based integrate-and-fire neurons, representing fast spiking inhibitor y and regular spiking excitator y cells. In order to compare the dynamical state spaces of previous studies with our network models we consider the following connectivity assumptions: purely random or purely local couplings, a combination of local and distant synapses, and connectivity structures with patchy projections. Similar to previous studies, we also find different dynamical states depending on the input parameters: the external input rate and the numerical relation between excitator y and inhibitor y synaptic weights. These states, e.g., synchronous regular ({SR}) or asynchronous irregular ({AI}) firing, are characterized by measures like the mean firing rate, the correlation coefficient, the coefficient of variation and so for th. On top of identified biologically realistic background states ({AI}), stimuli are applied in order to analyze their stability. Comparing the results of our different network models we find that the param- eter space necessar y to describe all possible dynamical states of a network is much more concentrated if local couplings are involved. The transition between different states is shifted (with respect to both in- put parameters) and shar pened in dependence of the relative amount of local couplings. Local couplings strongly enhance the mean firing rate, and lead to smaller values of the correlation coefficient. In terms of emergence of synchronous states, however, networks with local versus non-local or patchy versus random remote connections exhibit a higher probability of synchronized spiking. Concerning stability, preliminar y results indicate that again networks with local or patchy connections show a higher probability of changing from the {AI} to the {SR} state. We conclude that the combination of local and remote projections bears impor- tant consequences on the activity of network: The apparent differences we found for distinct connectivity assumptions in the dynamical state spaces suggest that network dynamics strongly depend on the con- nectivity structure. This effect might be even stronger with respect to the spatio-temporal spread of signal propagation. This work is suppor ted by {EC} {IP} project {FP6}-015879 ({FACETS}).},

	Abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of simple cortical cells as 1) a linear transform representing edges and 2) a non-linear iterative stage of inhibition and facilitation between neighboring coefficients. The linear transform is a complex {log-Gabor} wavelet transform which is overcomplete (i.e. there are more coefficients than pixels in the image) and has exact reconstruction. The inhibition consists in diminishing down the coefficients which are not at a local-maxima along the direction normal to the edge filter orientation, whereas the facilitation enhances the collinear and co-aligned local-maximum coefficients. At each iteration and after the inhibition and facilitation stages, the reconstructed error is subtracted in the transform domain for keeping an exact reconstruction. Such process concentrates the signal energy on a few coefficients situated along the edges of the objects, yielding a sparse representation. The rationale for such procedure is: (1) th e overcompleteness offers flexibility for activity reassignment; (2) images can be coded by sparse Gabor coefficients located on object edges; (3) image contours produce aligned and collinear local-maxima in the transform domain; (4) the inhibition/facilitation processes are able to extract the contours. The sparse Gabor coefficients are mostly connected each other and located along object contours. Such layout makes chain coding suitable for compression purposes. Specially adapted to Gabor wavelets features, our chain coding represents every chain by its end-points (head and tail) and the elementary movements necessary to walk along the chain from head to tail. Moreover it predicts the module and phase of each Gabor coefficient according to the previous chain coefficient. As a result, redundancy of the transform domain is further reduced. Used for compression, the scheme limits particularly the high-frequency artifacts. The model performs also efficiently in tasks the Human Visual System is supposed to deal with, as for instance edge extraction and image denoising.},

Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys (see poster of Reynaud et al., {VSS09}). Based on a previously developed Bayesian framework, we have developed an optimal statistical decoder of such an observed cortical population activity as recorded by optical imaging. This model aims at characterizing the statistical dependence between early neuronal activity and ocular responses and its performance was analyzed by comparing this neuronal read-out and the actual motor responses on a trial-by-trial basis. First, we show that relative performance of the behavioral contrast response function is similar to the best estimate obtained from the neural activity. In particular, we show that the latency of ocular response increases with low contrast conditions as well as with noisier instances of the behavioral task as decoded by the model. Then, we investigate the temporal dynamics of both neuronal and motor responses and show how motion information as represented by the model is integrated in space to improve population decoding over time. Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.

	Abstract = {Short presentation of a large moving pattern elicits an Ocular Following Response (OFR) that exhibits many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing such as spatial and temporal integration, contrast gain control and divisive interaction between competing motions. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in V1 cortical activity in response to center-surround gratings patterns measured with real-time optical imaging in awake monkeys. More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the global spatial integration of motion from an intermediate map of possible local translation velocities: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barthelemy06,Barthelemy07]. In fact, the machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensorimotor transformation is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss02] and we extended in the dynamical domain the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We proved that this model is successfully adapted to model the OFR for the different experiments [Perrinet07neurocomp], that is for different levels of noise with full field gratings, with disks of various sizes and also for the effect of a flickering surround. However, another \\emph{ad hoc} inhibitory mechanism has to be added in this model to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a recurrent prediction of information in the velocity map. In fact, in previous models, the integration step assumes independence of the local information while natural scenes are very predictable: Due to the rigidity and inertia of physical objects in visual space, neighboring local spatiotemporal information is redundant and one may introduce this \\emph{a priori} knowledge of the statistics of the input in the ideal observer model. We implement this in a realistic model of a layer representing velocities in a map of cortical columns, where predictions are implemented by lateral interactions within the cortical area. First, raw velocities are estimated locally from images and are propagated to this area in a feed-forward manner. Using this velocity map, we progressively learn the dependance of local velocities in a second layer of the model. This algorithm is cyclic since the prediction is using the local velocities which are themselves using both the feed-forward input and the prediction: We control the convergence of this process by measuring results for different learning rate. Results show that this simple model is sufficient to disambiguate characteristic patterns such as the Barber-Pole illusion. Due to the recursive network which is modulating the velocity map, it also explains that the representation may exhibit some memory, such as when an object suddenly disappears or when presenting a dot followed by a line (line-motion illusion). Finally, we applied this model that was tuned over a set of natural scenes to gratings of increasing sizes. We observed first that the feed-forward response as tuned to neurophysiological data gave lower responses at higher eccentricities, and that this effect was greater for higher grating frequencies. Then, we observed that depending on the size of the disk and on its spatial frequency, the recurrent network of lateral interactions Lastly, we explore how a surrounding velocity non congruous with the central excitation information shunts the ocular response and how it is topographically represented in the cortical activity.},

However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround. We explore here an hypothesis where this could be understood as the effect of a recurrent integration of information in the velocity map. F. Barthelemy, L. U. Perrinet, E. Castet, and G. S. Masson.

	Abstract = {Computations in a cortical column are characterized by the dynamical, event-based nature of neuronal signals and are structured by the layered and parallel structure of cortical areas. But they are also characterized by their efficiency in terms of rapidity and robustness. We propose and study here a model of information integration in the primary visual cortex (V1) thanks to the parallel and interconnected network of similar cortical columns. In particular, we focus on the dynamics of contrast gain control mechanisms as a function of the distribution of information relevance in a small population of cortical columns. This cortical area is modeled as a collection of similar cortical columns which receive input and are linked according to a specific connectivity pattern which is relevant to this area. These columns are simulated using the {\\sc Nest} simulator Morrison04 using conductance-based Integrate-and-Fire neurons and consist vertically in 3 different layers. The architecture was inspired by neuro-physiological observations on the influence of neighboring activities on pyramidal cells activity and correlates with the lateral flow of information observed in the primary visual cortex, notably in optical imaging experiments Jancke04, and is similar in its final implementation to local micro-circuitry of the cortical column presented by Grossberg05. \% They show prototypical spontaneous dynamical behavior to different levels of noise which are relevant to the generic modeling of biological cortical columns {Kremkow05}. In the future, the connectivity will be derived from an algorithm that was used for modeling the transient spiking response of a layer of neurons to a flashed image and which was based on the Matching Pursuit algorithm {Perrinet04}. \% The visual input is first transmitted from the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN) using the model of {Gazeres98}. It transforms the image flow into a stream of spikes with contrast gain control mechanisms specific to the retina and the LGN. This spiking activity converges to the pyramidal cells of layer 2/3 thanks to the specification of receptive fields in layer 4 providing a preference for oriented local contrasts in the spatio-temporal visual flow. In particular, we use in these experiments visual input organized in a center-surround spatial pattern which was optimized in size to maximize the response of a column in the center and to the modulation of this response by the surround (bipartite stimulus). This class of stimuli provide different levels of input activation and of visual ambiguity in the visual space which were present in the spatio-temporal correlations in the input spike flow optimized to the resolution of cortical columns in the visual space. It thus provides a method to reveal the dynamics of information integration and particularly of contrast gain control which are characteristic to the function of V1.},

	Abstract = {The integration of information is essential to measure the exact 2D motion of a surface from both local ambiguous 1D motion produced by elongated edges and local non-ambiguous 2D motion from features such as corners, end-points or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course which can be read from tracking eye movements: local 1D motion signals are extracted first and then pooled to initiate the ocular responses before that 2D motion signals are taken into account to refine the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these 1D and 2D motion computations is still unclear. Previously, we have shown that the late, 2D-driven response components to either plaids or barber-poles have very similar latencies over a large range of contrast, suggesting a shared mechanism. However, they showed different contrast response functions with these different motion stimuli, suggesting different motion processing. We designed a two-pathways Bayesian model of motion integration and showed that this family of contrast response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of 1D and 2D motion signals for each type of stimulus. Indeed, this formulation may explain contrast response functions that could not be explained by a simple bayesian model (Weiss et al., 2002 {\\em Nature Neuroscience} {\\bf 5} , 598--604) and gives a quantitative argument to study how local information with different relative ambiguities values may be pooled to provide an integrated response of the system. Finally, we formulate how different spatial information may be pooled and we draw the analogy of this method with methods using the partial derivative equations. This simple model correctly explains some non-linear interactions between neighboring neurons selective to motion direction which are observed in short-latency ocular following and neuro-physiological data.},

	Abstract = {When the visual information about an object's motion differs at the local level, the visuomotor system needs to integrate information across time to solve this ambiguity and converge to the final motion solution. For an oblique line moving horizontally, edge-related motion cues differ from terminator-related information, the latter being coherent with the line's global motion. We have previously shown that ocular tracking of this kind of stimuli is transiently biased toward the edge-orthogonal direction, before converging to the global motion direction. Here, we model the dynamic convergence to the global-motion solution as a recursive update of inferential knowledge in the velocity space. We assume that motion estimation is based on a prior distribution and two independent likelihood functions representing edge-related and terminator-related information. Importantly, the shape of the Bayesian functions is constrained by smooth-pursuit eye-movement data. Model predictions about the dynamic convergence to the correct motion solution are compared to human smooth-pursuit recordings when varying different stimulus parameters (speed, contrast).},

	Abstract = {Neurons receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs whose temporal interplay determines their spiking behavior. On average, excitation (Gexc) and inhibition (Ginh) balance each other, such that spikes are elicited by fluctuations [1]. In addition, it has been shown in vivo that Gexc and Ginh are correlated, with Ginh lagging Gexc only by few milliseconds (6ms), creating a small temporal integration window [2,3]. This correlation structure could be induced by feed-forward inhibition (FFI), which has been shown to be present at many sites in the central nervous system. To characterize the functional consequences of the FFI, we first modeled a simple circuit using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses and studied the effect on the single neuron integration. We then coupled many of such circuits to construct a feed-forward network (synfire chain [4,5]) and investigated the effect of FFI on signal propagation along such feed-forward network. We found that the small temporal integration window, induced by the FFI, changes the integrative properties of the neuron. Only transient stimuli could produce a response when the FFI was active whereas without FFI the neuron responded to both steady and transient stimuli. Due to the increase in selectivity to transient inputs, the conditions of signal propagation through the feed-forward network changed as well. Whereas synchronous inputs could reliable propagate, high asynchronous input rates, which are known to induce synfire activity [6], failed to do so. In summary, the FFI increased the stability of the synfire chain. Supported by DFG SFB 780, EU-15879-FACETS, BMBF 01GQ0420 to BCCN Freiburg [1] Kumar A., Schrader S., Aertsen A. and Rotter S. (2008).

	Abstract = {In the primary visual cortex (V1), single cell responses to simple visual stimuli (gratings) are usually dense but with a high trial-by-trial variability. In contrast, when exposed to full field natural scenes, the firing patterns of these neurons are sparse but highly reproducible over trials (Marre et al., 2005; Fr{\'{e}}gnac et al., 2006). It is still not understood how these two classes of stimuli can elicit these two distinct firing behaviours. A common model for simple-cell computation in layer 4 is the ``push-pull'' circuitry (Troyer et al. 1998). It accounts for the observed anti-phase behaviour between excitatory and inhibitory conductances in response to a drifting grating (Anderson et al., 2000; Monier et al., 2008), creating a wide temporal integration window during which excitation is integrated without the shunting or opponent effect of inhibition and allowed to elicit multiple spikes. This is in contrast to recent results from intracellular recordings in vivo during presentation of natural scenes (Baudot et al., submitted). Here the excitatory and inhibitory conductances were highly correlated, with inhibition lagging excitation only by few milliseconds (\~{}6 ms). This small lag creates a narrow temporal integration window such that only synchronized excitatory inputs can elicit a spike, similar to parallel observations in other cortical sensory areas (Wehr and Zador, 2003; Okun and Lampl, 2008). To investigate the cellular and network mechanisms underlying these two different correlation structures, we constructed a realistic model of the V1 network using spiking neurons with conductance based synapses. We calibrated our model to fit the irregular ongoing activity pattern as well as in vivo conductance measurements during drifting grating stimulation and then extracted predicted responses to natural scenes seen through eye-movements. Our simulations reproduced the above described experimental observation, together with anti-phase behaviour between excitation and inhibition during gratings and phase lagged activation during natural scenes. In conclusion, the same cortical network that shows dense and variable responses to gratings exhibits sparse and precise spiking to natural scenes. Work is under way to show to which extent this feature is specific for the feedforward vs recurrent nature of the modelled circuit.},

	Abstract = {Sensory input enters the cortex via the thalamocortical (TC) projection, where it elicits large postsynaptic potentials in layer 4 neurons [1]. Interestingly, the TC connections account for only \~{}15\% of synapses onto these neurons. It has been therefore controversially discussed how thalamic input can drive the cortex. Strong TC synapses have been one suggestion to ensure the strength of the TC projection ("strong-synapse model"). Another possibility is that the excitation from single thalamic fibers are weak but get amplified by recurrent excitatory feedback in layer 4 ("amplifier model"). Bruno and Sakmann [2] recently provided new evidence that individual TC synapses in vivo are weak and only produce small excitatory postsynaptic potentials. However, they suggested that thalamic input can activate the cortex due to the synchronous firing and that cortical amplification is not required. This would support the "synchrony model" proposed by correlation analysis [3]. Here, we studied the effect of correlation in the TC input, with weak synapses, to the responses of a layered cortical network model. The connectivity of the layered network was taken from Binzegger et al. 2004 [4]. The network was simulated using NEST [5] with the Python interface PyNN [6] to enable interoperability with different simulators. The sensory input to layer 4 was modelled by a simple retino-geniculate model of the transformation of light into spike trains [7], which was implemented by leaky integrate-and-fire model neurons. We found that introducing correlation into TC inputs enhanced the likelihood to produce responses in layer 4 and improved the activity propagation across layers. In addition, we compared the response of the cortical network to different noise conditions and obtained contrast response functions which were in accordance with neurophysiological observations.

	Abstract = {Low-level perceptual computations may be understood in terms of efficient codes (Simoncelli and Olshausen, 2001, Annual Review of Neuroscience 24 1193-216). Following this argument, we explore models of representation for natural static images as a way to understand the processing of information in the primary visual cortex. This representation is here based on a generative linear model of the synthesis of images using an over-complete multi-resolution dictionary of edges. This transform is implemented using {log-Gabor} filters and permits an exact reconstruction of any image. However, this linear representation is redundant and since to any image may correspond different representations, we explore more efficient representations of the image. The problem is stated as an ill-posed inverse problem and we compare first different known strategies by computing the efficiency of the solutions given by Matching Pursuit (Perrinet, 2004, {IEEE} Trans. Neural Networks 15 1164-75) and sparse edge coding (Fischer, in press, Trans. Image Processing) with classical representation methods such as {JPEG}. This comparison allows us to provide a synthesized approach using a probabilistic representation which would progressively construct the neural representation by using lateral cooperations. We propose an algorithm which dynamically diffuses information to correlated filters so as to yield a progressively disambiguated representation. This approach takes advantage of the computational properties of spiking neurons such as {Integrate-and-Fire} neurons and provides an efficient yet simple model for the representation of natural images. This representation is directly linked with the edge content of natural images and we show applications of this method to edge extraction, denoising and compression. We also show that this dynamical approach fits with neuro-physiological observations and may explain the non-linear interactions between neighboring neurons which may be observed in the cortex.},

	Abstract = {Trends in programming language development and adoption point to Python as the high-level systems integration language of choice. Python leverages a vast developer-base external to the neuroscience community, and promises leaps in simulation complexity and maintainability to any neural simulator that adopts it. {PyNN} {http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN} strives to provide a uniform application programming interface ({API}) across neural simulators. Presently {NEURON} and {NEST} are supported, and support for other simulators and neuromorphic {VLSI} hardware is under development. With {PyNN} it is possible to write a simulation script once and run it without modification on any supported simulator. It is also possible to write a script that uses capabilities specific to a single simulator. While this sacrifices simulator-independence, it adds flexibility, and can be a useful step in porting models between simulators. The design goals of {PyNN} include allowing access to low-level details of a simulation where necessary, while providing the capability to model at a high level of abstraction, with concomitant gains in development speed and simulation maintainability. Another of our aims with {PyNN} is to increase the productivity of neuroscience modeling, by making it faster to develop models de novo, by promoting code sharing and reuse across simulator communities, and by making it much easier to debug, test and validate simulations by running them on more than one simulator. Modelers would then become free to devote more software development effort to innovation, building on the simulator core with new tools such as network topology databases, stimulus programming, analysis and visualization tools, and simulation accounting. The resulting, community-developed 'meta-simulator' system would then represent a powerful tool for overcoming the so-called complexity bottleneck that is presently a major roadblock for neural modeling.},

It represents, in terms of spatial scale, a large piece of cortex allowing for long-range connections, resulting in a rather sparse connectivity. We use two different types of conductance-based {I\&F} neurons as excitatory and in- hibitory units, as well as specific connection probabilities. In order to re- main computationally tractable, we reduce neuron density, modelling part of the missing internal input via external poissonian spike trains. Compared to previous studies, we observe significant changes in the dynamical phase space: Altered activity patterns require another regularity measure than the coefficient of variation. We identify two types of mixed states, where differ- ent phases coexist in certain regions of the phase space. More notably, our boundary between high and low activity states depends predominantly on the relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength instead of the input rate.

	Abstract = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensori-motor transformation, such as in Ocular Following Response (OFR), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilis- tic framework by using Bayesian theory (Weiss et al., 2002) which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the OFR for different levels of noise with full field gratings (Perrinet et al., 2005). More recent experiments of OFR have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dy- namics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion : (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving OFR, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective sup- pressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stim- uli (Barth{\'{e}}lemy et al., 2006). Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a proba- bilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypoth- esis of independence of local measures can describe the integration of the spatial motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the con- trast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

	Abstract = {A goal of low-level neural processes is to build an efficient code extracting the relevant information from the sensory input. It is believed that this is implemented in cortical areas by elementary inferential computations dynamically extracting the most likely parameters corresponding to the sensory signal. We explore here a neuro-mimetic feed-forward model of the primary visual area (V1) solving this problem in the case where the signal may be described by a robust linear gen- erative model. This model uses an over-complete dictionary of primitives which provides a distributed probabilistic representation of input features. Relying on an efficiency criterion, we derive an algorithm as an approximate solution which uses incremental greedy inference processes. This algorithm is similar to 'Matching Pursuit' and mimics the parallel architecture of neural computations. We propose here a simple implementation using a network of spiking integrate-and-fire neu- rons which communicate using lateral interactions. Numerical simulations show that this Sparse Spike Coding strategy provides an efficient model for representing visual data from a set of natural images. Even though it is simplistic, this trans- formation of spatial data into a spatio-temporal pattern of binary events provides an accurate description of some complex neural patterns observed in the spiking activity of biological neural networks.},

	Abstract = {To understand possible strategies of temporal spike coding in the central nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe [1] and which represents the multi- scale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary ---and possibly non-orthogonal--- representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the perfor- mance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that, when the visual information about an object's motion differs on the local (edge-related) and global levels, the local {1D} motion cues dominate initially, whereas {2D} information takes progressively over and leads to the final correct representation of global motion. Previous models have explained the initial errors (deviations from the global motion) in terms of best perceptual guess in the Bayesian sense. These models accounted for the intrinsic sensory noise of the image and general expectancies for object velocities. Here we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, with the purpose of encompassing the whole dynamical evolution of motion processing, from the {1D} cues to the correct global motion. Our model is motivated and constrained by smooth pursuit oculomotor data. Eye movements were recorded in 3 participants using the scleral search coil technique. Participants were asked to track either a single line (vertical or oblique) or a Gaussian blob moving horizontally. In our model, oculomotor data obtained with non ambiguous stimuli (e.g. with coherent local and global information, such as a Gaussian blob or a vertical line moving horizontally) are combined to constrain the initial likelihood and prior functions for the general, ambiguous case (e.g. a tilted line moving horizontally). The prior knowledge is then recursively updated by using the previous posterior probability as the current prior. The idea is that the recursive injection of posterior distribution boosts the spread of information about the object's shape, favoring the integration of {1D} and {2D} cues. In addition, a simple model of the sensory-oculomotor loop is taken into account, including transmission delays and the evolution of the retinal motion during pursuit. Preliminary results show substantial agreement between the model prediction and the oculomotor data.},

	Abstract = {Neurons in the neocortex receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). Simple circuits show that an effective {FFI} changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective {FFI} increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {Under natural viewing conditions, small movements of the eyes prevent the maintenance of a steady direction of gaze. It is unclear how the spatiotemporal content of the fixated scene has an impact on the properties of miniatures, fixational eye movements. We have investigated the characteristics of fixational eye movements recorded while human subjects are instructed to fixate natural statistics random textures (Motion Clouds) in which we manipulated the spatial frequency content. We used long presentations (5 sec) of Motion Clouds stimuli (Schrater et al. 2000) of varying spatial frequency bandwidths (Bsf) around different central spatial frequency (Sf0). We found that central spatial frequency has an effect upon microsaccadic eye movements. In particular, smaller saccadic amplitudes were associated with high spatial frequencies, and larger saccades with low spatial frequencies. Broadening the spatial frequency bandwidth also changed the distribution of microsaccade amplitudes. A lower spatial frequencies, larger Bsf resulted in a large reduction of microsaccades amplitude while fixation behavior for high spatial frequencies texture was not affected. Relationship between microsaccade rate and intersaccadic timing was also dependent upon Bsf. These results suggest that the spatial frequency content of the fixated images have a strong impact upon fixation instability. Paul R. Schrater, David C. Knill and Eero P.

	Abstract = {Humans are able to interact successfully with moving objects in our dynamic world and the visual system effi ciently performs the motion computation that makes this possible. Object speed and direction are estimated following the integration of information across cortical motion sensitive channels. Speed estimation along this system is not fully understood, particularly the mapping function between the actual speed of viewed objects and that perceived by observers, a question we address in this work. It has been demonstrated that perceived speed is profoundly influenced by object contrast, spatial frequency, stimulus complexity and frequency bandwidth. In a 2 interval forced choice speed discrimination task, we present a random phase textured motion stimulus to probe small shifts in perceived speed measured using fi xed stimulus sets as reference scales while mean spatial frequency and bandwidths serve as the dependent variable in a probe. The presentations are short (200ms). Using a scale of narrowband stimuli (0.2 octaves), we measured a shift in perceived speed; higher frequencies are seen as faster moving than lower ones. On the scale of broader bandwidth (1 octave), this difference across frequency was reduced and perceived speed seems to converge on a slower representation. From these results we estimated this mapping between perceived and veridical stimulus speeds. In direct comparisons, the relative speed is faster for high frequencies and increases in bandwidth make stimuli appear slower. During this early computation, when presented with a random phase stimulus it appears that the visual systems makes assumptions about expected speeds based on the richness of the frequency content and the veridical speed is not explicitly computed. In this first 200ms, the perceptual system perhaps underestimates some speeds in an optimal response for initially stabilizing the scene. Acknowledgement: {CNRS} \& Brainscales {FP7}},

	Abstract = {The visual system does not process information instantaneously, but rather integrates over time. Integration occurs both for stationary objects and moving objects, with very similar time constants (Burr, 1981). We measured, as a function of exposure duration, speed discrimination and ocular following performance for rich textured motion stimuli of varying spatial frequency bandwidth. Psychometric sensitivity and Oculometric sensitivity for these patterns increased with exposure duration. However the best stimuli for ocular following (namely those with a large bandwidth for spatial frequency) was well integrated up to about 150 - 200 msec, while the best stimuli for speed discrimination (small bandwidth) was well integrated up to about 300 msec. Interestingly, discriminability of ocular tracking eye movements follow a non-monotonic time course, due to the contribution of motor noise. These results suggest that although perception and action relies work in synergy, they may be described by two different integrating mechanisms: A low level, fast one guiding the ocular movement to enable one to catch stimuli in the visual fi eld quickly; and a slower one being able to measure the speed difference between two objects translating in the visual fi eld.

@article{Hunt13,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields acquired through unsupervised learning of sparse representations of natural scenes have similar properties to primary visual cortex (V1) simple cell receptive fields. However, what drives in vivo development of receptive fields remains controversial. The strongest evidence for the importance of sensory experience in visual development comes from receptive field changes in animals reared with abnormal visual input. However, most sparse coding accounts have considered only normal visual input and the development of monocular receptive fields. Here, we applied three sparse coding models to binocular receptive field development across six abnormal rearing conditions. In every condition, the changes in receptive field properties previously observed experimentally were matched to a similar and highly faithful degree by all the models, suggesting that early sensory development can indeed be understood in terms of an impetus towards sparsity. As previously predicted in the literature, we found that asymmetries in inter-ocular correlation across orientations lead to orientation-specific binocular receptive fields. Finally we used our models to design a novel stimulus that, if present during rearing, is predicted by the sparsity principle to lead robustly to radically abnormal receptive fields. The responses of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), a region of the brain involved in encoding visual input, are modified by the visual experience of the animal during development. For example, most neurons in animals reared viewing stripes of a particular orientation only respond to the orientation that the animal experienced. The responses of V1 cells in normal animals are similar to responses that simple optimisation algorithms can learn when trained on images. However, whether the similarity between these algorithms and V1 responses is merely coincidental has been unclear. Here, we used the results of a number of experiments where animals were reared with modified visual experience to test the explanatory power of three related optimisation algorithms. We did this by filtering the images for the algorithms in ways that mimicked the visual experience of the animals. This allowed us to show that the changes in V1 responses in experiment were consistent with the algorithms. This is evidence that the precepts of the algorithms, notably sparsity, can be used to understand the development of V1 responses. Further, we used our model to propose a novel rearing condition which we expect to have a dramatic effect on development.},

@article{Nessler13,
	Abstract = {The principles by which networks of neurons compute, and how spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}) of synaptic weights generates and maintains their computational function, are unknown. Preceding work has shown that soft winner-take-all ({WTA}) circuits, where pyramidal neurons inhibit each other via interneurons, are a common motif of cortical microcircuits. We show through theoretical analysis and computer simulations that Bayesian computation is induced in these network motifs through {STDP} in combination with activity-dependent changes in the excitability of neurons. The fundamental components of this emergent Bayesian computation are priors that result from adaptation of neuronal excitability and implicit generative models for hidden causes that are created in the synaptic weights through {STDP}. In fact, a surprising result is that {STDP} is able to approximate a powerful principle for fitting such implicit generative models to high-dimensional spike inputs: Expectation Maximization. Our results suggest that the experimentally observed spontaneous activity and trial-to-trial variability of cortical neurons are essential features of their information processing capability, since their functional role is to represent probability distributions rather than static neural codes. Furthermore it suggests networks of Bayesian computation modules as a new model for distributed information processing in the cortex. How do neurons learn to extract information from their inputs, and perform meaningful computations? Neurons receive inputs as continuous streams of action potentials or '' spikes'' that arrive at thousands of synapses. The strength of these synapses - the synaptic weight - undergoes constant modification. It has been demonstrated in numerous experiments that this modification depends on the temporal order of spikes in the pre- and postsynaptic neuron, a rule known as {STDP}, but it has remained unclear, how this contributes to higher level functions in neural network architectures. In this paper we show that {STDP} induces in a commonly found connectivity motif in the cortex - a winner-take-all ({WTA}) network - autonomous, self-organized learning of probabilistic models of the input. The resulting function of the neural circuit is Bayesian computation on the input spike trains. Such unsupervised learning has previously been studied extensively on an abstract, algorithmical level. We show that {STDP} approximates one of the most powerful learning methods in machine learning, {Expectation-Maximization} ({EM}). In a series of computer simulations we demonstrate that this enables {STDP} in {WTA} circuits to solve complex learning tasks, reaching a performance level that surpasses previous uses of spiking neural networks.},

	Abstract = {Humans take into account their own movement variability as well as potential consequences of different movement outcomes in planning movement trajectories. When variability increases, planned movements are altered so as to optimize expected consequences of the movement. Past research has focused on the steady-state responses to changing conditions of movement under risk. Here, we study the dynamics of such strategy adjustment in a visuomotor decision task in which subjects reach toward a display with regions that lead to rewards and penalties, under conditions of changing uncertainty. In typical reinforcement learning tasks, subjects should base subsequent strategy by computing an estimate of the mean outcome (e.g., reward) in recent trials. In contrast, in our task, strategy should be based on a dynamic estimate of recent outcome uncertainty (i.e., squared error). We find that subjects respond to increased movement uncertainty by aiming movements more conservatively with respect to penalty regions, and that the estimate of uncertainty they use is well characterized by a weighted average of recent squared errors, with higher weights given to more recent trials.},

	Abstract = {The brain faces the problem of inferring reliable hidden causes from large populations of noisy neurons, for example, the direction of a moving object from spikes in area {MT}. It is known that a theoretically optimal likelihood decoding could be carried out by simple linear readout neurons if weights of synaptic connections were set to certain values that depend on the tuning functions of sensory neurons. We show here that such theoretically optimal readout weights emerge autonomously through {STDP} in conjunction with lateral inhibition between readout neurons. In particular, we identify a class of optimal {STDP} learning rules with homeostatic plasticity, for which the autonomous emergence of optimal readouts can be explained on the basis of a rigorous learning theory. This theory shows that the network motif we consider approximates expectation-maximization for creating internal generative models for hidden causes of high-dimensional spike inputs. Notably, we find that this optimal functionality can be well approximated by a variety of {STDP} rules beyond those predicted by theory. Furthermore, we show that this learning process is very stable and automatically adjusts weights to changes in the number of readout neurons, the tuning functions of sensory neurons, and the statistics of external stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Sensory receptive fields ({RFs}) vary as a function of stimulus properties and measurement methods. Previous stimuli or surrounding stimuli facilitate, suppress, or change the selectivity of sensory neurons' responses. Here, we propose that these spatiotemporal contextual dependencies are signatures of efficient perceptual inference and can be explained by a single neural mechanism, input targeted divisive inhibition. To respond both selectively and reliably, sensory neurons should behave as active predictors rather than passive filters. In particular, they should remove input they can predict ( '' explain away'') from the synaptic inputs to all other neurons. This implies that {RFs} are constantly and dynamically reshaped by the spatial and temporal context, while the true selectivity of sensory neurons resides in their '' predictive field.'' This approach motivates a reinvestigation of sensory representations and particularly the role and specificity of surround suppression and adaptation in sensory areas.},

	Abstract = {We often need to learn how to move based on a single performance measure that reflects the overall success of our movements. However, movements have many properties, such as their trajectories, speeds and timing of end-points, thus the brain needs to decide which properties of movements should be improved; it needs to solve the credit assignment problem. Currently, little is known about how humans solve credit assignment problems in the context of reinforcement learning. Here we tested how human participants solve such problems during a trajectory-learning task. Without an explicitly-defined target movement, participants made hand reaches and received monetary rewards as feedback on a trial-by-trial basis. The curvature and direction of the attempted reach trajectories determined the monetary rewards received in a manner that can be manipulated experimentally. Based on the history of action-reward pairs, participants quickly solved the credit assignment problem and learned the implicit payoff function. A Bayesian credit-assignment model with built-in forgetting accurately predicts their trial-by-trial learning.},

	Abstract = {Local field potentials ({LFP}) reflect the properties of neuronal circuits or columns recorded in a volume around a microelectrode (Buzs\'{a}ki et al., 2012). The extent of this integration volume has been a subject of some debate, with estimates ranging from a few hundred microns (Katzner et al., 2009; Xing et al., 2009) to several millimeters (Kreiman et al., 2006). We estimated receptive fields ({RFs}) of multi-unit activity ({MUA}) and {LFPs} at an intermediate level of visual processing, in area V4 of two macaques. The spatial structure of {LFP} receptive fields varied greatly as a function of time lag following stimulus onset, with the retinotopy of {LFPs} matching that of {MUAs} at a restricted set of time lags. A model-based analysis of the {LFPs} allowed us to recover two distinct stimulus-triggered components: an {MUA}-like retinotopic component that originated in a small volume around the microelectrodes (\~{}350 μm), and a second component that was shared across the entire V4 region; this second component had tuning properties unrelated to those of the {MUAs}. Our results suggest that the {LFP} reflects neural activity across multiple spatial scales, which both complicates its interpretation and offers new opportunities for investigating the large-scale structure of network processing.},

	Abstract = {Information processing in the cerebral cortex invariably involves the activation of millions of neurons that are widely distributed over its various areas. These distributed activity patterns need to be integrated into coherent representational states. A candidate mechanism for the integration and coordination of neuronal activity between different brain regions is synchronization on a fine temporal scale. In the visual cortex, synchronization occurs selectively between the responses of neurons that represent related features and that need to be integrated for the generation of coherent percepts; neurons in other areas of the cerebral cortex also synchronize their discharges. However, little is known about the patterns and the behavioural correlates of synchrony among widely separated cortical regions. Here we report that synchronization occurs between areas of the visual and parietal cortex, and between areas of the parietal and motor cortex, in the awake cat. When cats responded to a sudden change of a visual pattern, neuronal activity in cortical areas exhibited synchrony without time lags; this synchrony was particularly strong between areas subserving related functions. During reward and inter-trial episodes, zero-time-lag synchrony was lost and replaced by interactions exhibiting large and unsystematic time lags.},

@article{McAnany09,
	Abstract = {Omitting a stimulus from a train of repetitive stimuli, by either interrupting or terminating the train, can elicit an electrophysiological response that occurs at the time appropriate for the omitted stimulus. This study investigated whether such an omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) is present in the flicker electroretinogram ({ERG}) of the human cone system. {ERGs} were recorded from 11 visually normal subjects in response to full-field sinusoidal flicker trains presented against a rod-desensitizing adapting field at frequencies ranging from 12.5 to 100 Hz. Recordings were synchronized with the onset of the stimulus trains, and the amplitude and relative delay of any additional {ERG} responses following the offset of the flicker train were analyzed. At stimulus frequencies below 35 Hz, the number of {ERG} responses always equaled the number of stimulus cycles. However, over the frequency range of 38.5 to 100 Hz, the {ERG} contained an extra response following flicker train offset. At stimulus frequencies from 38.5 to 62.5 Hz, there was a constant delay between the peak of the extra {ERG} response and the time at which the next stimulus would have occurred had the flicker train continued. This constant delay is characteristic of an {OSR}. In addition, an extra {ERG} response was apparent at these same stimulus frequencies if the flicker train was interrupted by omitting stimulus cycles from the middle of the train. The pattern of {ERG} findings is consistent with a recently proposed model of the {OSR} that attributes the phenomenon to a resonant oscillation in retinal bipolar cells.},

@article{Linaro11,
	Abstract = {Stochastic channel gating is the major source of intrinsic neuronal noise whose functional consequences at the microcircuit- and network-levels have been only partly explored. A systematic study of this channel noise in large ensembles of biophysically detailed model neurons calls for the availability of fast numerical methods. In fact, exact techniques employ the microscopic simulation of the random opening and closing of individual ion channels, usually based on Markov models, whose computational loads are prohibitive for next generation massive computer models of the brain. In this work, we operatively define a procedure for translating any Markov model describing voltage- or ligand-gated membrane ion-conductances into an effective stochastic version, whose computer simulation is efficient, without compromising accuracy. Our approximation is based on an improved Langevin-like approach, which employs stochastic differential equations and no Montecarlo methods. As opposed to an earlier proposal recently debated in the literature, our approximation reproduces accurately the statistical properties of the exact microscopic simulations, under a variety of conditions, from spontaneous to evoked response features. In addition, our method is not restricted to the {Hodgkin-Huxley} sodium and potassium currents and is general for a variety of voltage- and ligand-gated ion currents. As a by-product, the analysis of the properties emerging in exact Markov schemes by standard probability calculus enables us for the first time to analytically identify the sources of inaccuracy of the previous proposal, while providing solid ground for its modification and improvement we present here. A possible approach to understanding the neuronal bases of the computational properties of the nervous system consists of modelling its basic building blocks, neurons and synapses, and then simulating their collective activity emerging in large networks. In developing such models, a satisfactory description level must be chosen as a compromise between simplicity and faithfulness in reproducing experimental data. Deterministic neuron models -- i.e., models that upon repeated simulation with fixed parameter values provide the same results -- are usually made up of ordinary differential equations and allow for relatively fast simulation times. By contrast, they do not describe accurately the underlying stochastic response properties arising from the microscopical correlate of neuronal excitability. Stochastic models are usually based on mathematical descriptions of individual ion channels, or on an effective macroscopic account of their random opening and closing. In this contribution we describe a general method to transform any deterministic neuron model into its effective stochastic version that accurately replicates the statistical properties of ion channels random kinetics.},

We stimulated with sequences of gratings flashed for 30--40 ms at random orientations and spatial phases (Ringach et al., 1997). We expressed population responses to this stimulus as a function of preferred orientation. We could predict these responses to a considerable degree on the basis of a simple linear filter that describes the average response to a given orientation as a function of time. This filter was separable, i.e. it was the product of a function of preferred orientation and a function of time. Separability indicates that activity in the orientation domain is a standing wave (it neither broadens nor sharpens over time). We then studied how activity evolves in the spatial domain. We stimulated with small patches of standing gratings whose contrast reversed at ∼ 5 Hz. These stimuli elicited strong responses at twice that frequency (∼10 Hz), consistent with an origin in complex cells. The activity extended over a few mm of cortex, with response phase showing a clear dependence on distance from the stimulated site. This behavior is evidence for a traveling wave. We conclude that visual stimuli elicit waves of activation in visual cortex: standing waves in the orientation domain, and traveling waves in the spatial domain.},

@article{Bringuier99,
	Abstract = {The receptive field of a visual neuron is classically defined as the region of space (or retina) where a visual stimulus evokes a change in its firing activity. At the cortical level, a challenging issue concerns the roles of feedforward, local recurrent, intracortical, and cortico-cortical feedback connectivity in receptive field properties. Intracellular recordings in cat area 17 showed that the visually evoked synaptic integration field extends over a much larger area than that established on the basis of spike activity. Synaptic depolarizing responses to stimuli flashed at increasing distances from the center of the receptive field decreased in strength, whereas their onset latency increased. These findings suggest that subthreshold responses in the unresponsive region surrounding the classical discharge field result from the integration of visual activation waves spread by slowly conducting horizontal axons within primary visual cortex.},

@article{Contreras97,
	Abstract = {Spindle oscillations (7-14 Hz) appear in the thalamus and cortex during early stages of sleep. They are generated by the combination of intrinsic properties and connectivity patterns of thalamic neurons and distributed to cortical territories by thalamocortical axons. The corticothalamic feedback is a major factor in producing coherent spatiotemporal maps of spindle oscillations in widespread thalamic territories. Here we have investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneously occurring and evoked spindles by means of multisite field potential and unit recordings in intact cortex and decorticated animals. We show that (1) spontaneous spindle oscillations are synchronized over large cortical areas during natural sleep and barbiturate anesthesia; (2) under barbiturate anesthesia, the cortical coherence is not disrupted by transection of intracortical synaptic linkages; (3) in intact cortex animals, spontaneously occurring barbiturate spindle sequences occur nearly simultaneously over widespread thalamic territories; (4) in the absence of cortex, the spontaneous spindle oscillations throughout the thalamus are less organized, but the local coherence (within 2-4 mm) is still maintained; and (5) spindling propagation is observed in intact cortex animals only when elicited by low intensity cortical stimulation, applied shortly before the initiation of a spontaneous spindle sequence; propagation velocities are between 1 and 3 mm/sec, measured in the anteroposterior axis of the thalamus; increasing the intensity of cortical stimulation triggers spindle oscillations, which start simultaneously in all leads. We propose that, in vivo, the coherence of spontaneous spindle oscillations in corticothalamic networks is attributable to the combined action of continuous background corticothalamic input initiating spindle sequences in several thalamic sites at the same time and divergent corticothalamic and intrathalamic connectivity.},

@article{Watamaniuk95a,
	Abstract = {Human observers can easily detect a signal dot moving, in apparent motion, on a trajectory embedded in a background of random-direction motion noise. A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate 3or detecting the signal dot was as high as 90\% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a '' string'' of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250--400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.},

	Abstract = {Several recent studies have shown that extracting pattern motion direction is a dynamical process where edge motion is first extracted and pattern-related information is encoded with a small time lag by {MT} neurons. A similar dynamics was found for human reflexive or voluntary tracking. Here, we bring an essential, but still missing, piece of information by documenting macaque ocular following responses to gratings, unikinetic plaids, and barber-poles. We found that ocular tracking was always initiated first in the grating motion direction with ultra-short latencies (approximately 55 ms). A second component was driven only 10-15 ms later, rotating tracking toward pattern motion direction. At the end the open-loop period, tracking direction was aligned with pattern motion direction (plaids) or the average of the line-ending motion directions (barber-poles). We characterized the dependency on contrast of each component. Both timing and direction of ocular following were quantitatively very consistent with the dynamics of neuronal responses reported by others. Overall, we found a remarkable consistency between neuronal dynamics and monkey behavior, advocating for a direct link between the neuronal solution of the aperture problem and primate perception and action.},

	Abstract = {Neural populations encode information about their stimulus in a collective fashion, by joint activity patterns of spiking and silence. A full account of this mapping from stimulus to neural activity is given by the conditional probability distribution over neural codewords given the sensory input. For large populations, direct sampling of these distributions is impossible, and so we must rely on constructing appropriate models. We show here that in a population of 100 retinal ganglion cells in the salamander retina responding to temporal white-noise stimuli, dependencies between cells play an important encoding role. We introduce the stimulus-dependent maximum entropy ({SDME}) model---a minimal extension of the canonical linear-nonlinear model of a single neuron, to a pairwise-coupled neural population. We find that the {SDME} model gives a more accurate account of single cell responses and in particular significantly outperforms uncoupled models in reproducing the distributions of population codewords emitted in response to a stimulus. We show how the {SDME} model, in conjunction with static maximum entropy models of population vocabulary, can be used to estimate information-theoretic quantities like average surprise and information transmission in a neural population. In the sensory periphery, stimuli are represented by patterns of spikes and silences across a population of sensory neurons. Because the neurons form an interconnected network, the code cannot be understood by looking at single cells alone. Recent recordings in the retina have enabled us to study populations of a hundred or more neurons that carry the visual information into the brain, and thus build probabilistic models of the neural code. Here we present a minimal (maximum entropy) yet powerful extension of well-known linear/nonlinear models for independent neurons, to an interacting population. This model reproduces the behavior of single cells as well as the structure of correlations in neural spiking. Our model predicts much better the complete set of patterns of spiking and silence across a population of cells, allowing us to explore the properties of the stimulus-response mapping, and estimate the information transmission, in bits per second, that the population carries about the stimulus. Our results show that to understand the code, we need to shift our focus from reproducing single-cell properties (such as firing rates) towards understanding the total '' vocabulary'' of patterns emitted by the population, and that network correlations play a central role in shaping the code of large neural populations.},

@article{Fremaux13,
	Abstract = {Animals repeat rewarded behaviors, but the physiological basis of reward-based learning has only been partially elucidated. On one hand, experimental evidence shows that the neuromodulator dopamine carries information about rewards and affects synaptic plasticity. On the other hand, the theory of reinforcement learning provides a framework for reward-based learning. Recent models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity have made first steps towards bridging the gap between the two approaches, but faced two problems. First, reinforcement learning is typically formulated in a discrete framework, ill-adapted to the description of natural situations. Second, biologically plausible models of reward-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity require precise calculation of the reward prediction error, yet it remains to be shown how this can be computed by neurons. Here we propose a solution to these problems by extending the continuous temporal difference ({TD}) learning of Doya (2000) to the case of spiking neurons in an actor-critic network operating in continuous time, and with continuous state and action representations. In our model, the critic learns to predict expected future rewards in real time. Its activity, together with actual rewards, conditions the delivery of a neuromodulatory {TD} signal to itself and to the actor, which is responsible for action choice. In simulations, we show that such an architecture can solve a Morris water-maze-like navigation task, in a number of trials consistent with reported animal performance. We also use our model to solve the acrobot and the cartpole problems, two complex motor control tasks. Our model provides a plausible way of computing reward prediction error in the brain. Moreover, the analytically derived learning rule is consistent with experimental evidence for dopamine-modulated spike-timing-dependent plasticity. As every dog owner knows, animals repeat behaviors that earn them rewards. But what is the brain machinery that underlies this reward-based learning? Experimental research points to plasticity of the synaptic connections between neurons, with an important role played by the neuromodulator dopamine, but the exact way synaptic activity and neuromodulation interact during learning is not precisely understood. Here we propose a model explaining how reward signals might interplay with synaptic plasticity, and use the model to solve a simulated maze navigation task. Our model extends an idea from the theory of reinforcement learning: one group of neurons form an '' actor,'' responsible for choosing the direction of motion of the animal. Another group of neurons, the '' critic,'' whose role is to predict the rewards the actor will gain, uses the mismatch between actual and expected reward to teach the synapses feeding both groups. Our learning agent learns to reliably navigate its maze to find the reward. Remarkably, the synaptic learning rule that we derive from theoretical considerations is similar to previous rules based on experimental evidence.},

@article{Standage13,
	Abstract = {Our actions take place in space and time, but despite the role of time in decision theory and the growing acknowledgement that the encoding of time is crucial to behaviour, few studies have considered the interactions between neural codes for objects in space and for elapsed time during perceptual decisions. The speed-accuracy trade-off ({SAT}) provides a window into spatiotemporal interactions. Our hypothesis is that temporal coding determines the rate at which spatial evidence is integrated, controlling the {SAT} by gain modulation. Here, we propose that local cortical circuits are inherently suited to the relevant spatial and temporal coding. In simulations of an interval estimation task, we use a generic local-circuit model to encode time by 'climbing' activity, seen in cortex during tasks with a timing requirement. The model is a network of simulated pyramidal cells and inhibitory interneurons, connected by conductance synapses. A simple learning rule enables the network to quickly produce new interval estimates, which show signature characteristics of estimates by experimental subjects. Analysis of network dynamics formally characterizes this generic, local-circuit timing mechanism. In simulations of a perceptual decision task, we couple two such networks. Network function is determined only by spatial selectivity and {NMDA} receptor conductance strength; all other parameters are identical. To trade speed and accuracy, the timing network simply learns longer or shorter intervals, driving the rate of downstream decision processing by spatially non-selective input, an established form of gain modulation. Like the timing network's interval estimates, decision times show signature characteristics of those by experimental subjects. Overall, we propose, demonstrate and analyse a generic mechanism for timing, a generic mechanism for modulation of decision processing by temporal codes, and we make predictions for experimental verification. Studies in neuroscience have characterized how the brain represents objects in space and how these objects are selected for detailed perceptual processing. The selection process entails a decision about which object is favoured by the available evidence over time. This period of time is typically in the range of hundreds of milliseconds and is widely believed to be crucial for decisions, allowing neurons to filter noise in the evidence. Despite the widespread belief that time plays this role in decisions and the growing recognition that the brain estimates elapsed time during perceptual tasks, few studies have considered how the encoding of time effects decision making. We propose that neurons encode time in this range by the same general mechanisms used to select objects for detailed processing, and that these temporal representations determine how long evidence is filtered. To this end, we simulate a perceptual decision by coupling two instances of a neural network widely used to simulate localized regions of the cerebral cortex. One network encodes the passage of time and the other makes decisions based on noisy evidence. The former influences the performance of the latter, reproducing signature characteristics of temporal estimates and perceptual decisions.},

Here we theoretically investigate to what extent common synaptic afferents and synchronized inputs each contribute to correlated spiking on a fine temporal scale between pairs of neurons. We employ direct simulation and extend earlier analytical methods based on the diffusion approximation to pulse-coupling, allowing us to introduce precisely timed correlations in the spiking activity of the synaptic afferents. We investigate the transmission of correlated synaptic input currents by pairs of integrate-and-fire model neurons, so that the same input covariance can be realized by common inputs or by spiking synchrony. We identify two distinct regimes: In the limit of low correlation linear perturbation theory accurately determines the correlation transmission coefficient, which is typically smaller than unity, but increases sensitively even for weakly synchronous inputs. In the limit of high input correlation, in the presence of synchrony, a qualitatively new picture arises. As the non-linear neuronal response becomes dominant, the output correlation becomes higher than the total correlation in the input. This transmission coefficient larger unity is a direct consequence of non-linear neural processing in the presence of noise, elucidating how synchrony-coded signals benefit from these generic properties present in cortical networks. Whether spike timing conveys information in cortical networks or whether the firing rate alone is sufficient is a matter of controversial debate, touching the fundamental question of how the brain processes, stores, and conveys information. If the firing rate alone is the decisive signal used in the brain, correlations between action potentials are just an epiphenomenon of cortical connectivity, where pairs of neurons share a considerable fraction of common afferents. Due to membrane leakage, small synaptic amplitudes and the non-linear threshold, nerve cells exhibit lossy transmission of correlation originating from shared synaptic inputs. However, the membrane potential of cortical neurons often displays {non-Gaussian} fluctuations, caused by synchronized synaptic inputs. Moreover, synchronously active neurons have been found to reflect behavior in primates. In this work we therefore contrast the transmission of correlation due to shared afferents and due to synchronously arriving synaptic impulses for leaky neuron models. We not only find that neurons are highly sensitive to synchronous afferents, but that they can suppress noise on signals transmitted by synchrony, a computational advantage over rate signals.},

	Abstract = {The thalamus is crucial in determining the sensory information conveyed to cortex. In the visual system, the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) is generally thought to encode simple center-surround receptive fields, which are combined into more sophisticated features in cortex, such as orientation and direction selectivity. However, recent evidence suggests that a more diverse set of retinal ganglion cells projects to the {LGN}. We therefore used multisite extracellular recordings to define the repertoire of visual features represented in the {LGN} of mouse, an emerging model for visual processing. In addition to center-surround cells, we discovered a substantial population with more selective coding properties, including direction and orientation selectivity, as well as neurons that signal absence of contrast in a visual scene. The direction and orientation selective neurons were enriched in regions that match the termination zones of direction selective ganglion cells from the retina, suggesting a source for their tuning. Together, these data demonstrate that the mouse {LGN} contains a far more elaborate representation of the visual scene than current models posit. These findings should therefore have a significant impact on our understanding of the computations performed in mouse visual cortex.},

	Abstract = {Sparse coding models of natural scenes can account for several physiological properties of primary visual cortex (V1), including the shapes of simple cell receptive fields ({RFs}) and the highly kurtotic firing rates of V1 neurons. Current spiking network models of pattern learning and sparse coding require direct inhibitory connections between the excitatory simple cells, in conflict with the physiological distinction between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory ({GABAergic}) neurons (Dale's Law). At the same time, the computational role of inhibitory neurons in cortical microcircuit function has yet to be fully explained. Here we show that adding a separate population of inhibitory neurons to a spiking model of V1 provides conformance to Dale's Law, proposes a computational role for at least one class of interneurons, and accounts for certain observed physiological properties in V1. When trained on natural images, this excitatory--inhibitory spiking circuit learns a sparse code with Gabor-like {RFs} as found in V1 using only local synaptic plasticity rules. The inhibitory neurons enable sparse code formation by suppressing predictable spikes, which actively decorrelates the excitatory population. The model predicts that only a small number of inhibitory cells is required relative to excitatory cells and that excitatory and inhibitory input should be correlated, in agreement with experimental findings in visual cortex. We also introduce a novel local learning rule that measures stimulus-dependent correlations between neurons to support '' explaining away'' mechanisms in neural coding.},

@article{Said13,
	Abstract = {Binocular rivalry and cross-orientation suppression are well-studied forms of competition in visual cortex, but models of these two types of competition are in tension with one another. Binocular rivalry occurs during the presentation of dichoptic grating stimuli, where two orthogonal gratings presented separately to the two eyes evoke strong alternations in perceptual dominance. Cross-orientation suppression occurs during the presentation of plaid stimuli, where the responses to a component grating presented to both eyes is weakened by the presence of a superimposed orthogonal grating. Conventional models of rivalry that rely on strong competition between orientation-selective neurons incorrectly predict rivalry between the components of plaids. Lowering the inhibitory weights in such models reduces rivalry for plaids, but also reduces it for dichoptic gratings. Using an exhaustive grid search, we show that this problem cannot be solved simply by adjusting the parameters of the model. Instead, we propose a robust class of models that rely on ocular opponency neurons, previously proposed as a mechanism for efficient stereo coding, to yield rivalry only for dichoptic gratings, not for plaids. This class of models reconciles models of binocular rivalry with the divisive normalization framework that has been used to explain cross-orientation. Our model makes novel predictions that we confirmed with psychophysical tests. Binocular rivalry is a visual illusion that occurs when the two eyes are presented with incompatible images. Instead of perceiving a mixture of the two images, most people tend to experiences alternations in which they only see one image at a time. Binocular rivalry is more than just an interesting illusion: it reflects actual competition between neurons in the brain, and therefore provides a rare window into neural dynamics. To help us understand these mechanisms, researchers have developed several computational models of binocular rivalry. Yet surprisingly, as we show in this paper, previous computational models of rivalry make an incorrect prediction. They predict that certain types of images (similar to checkerboards) will cause strong perceptual alternations even when viewed normally. Since this prediction doesn't hold up, the existing models must not be telling the whole story. In this paper, we develop a new model of binocular rivalry that doesn't make this prediction. The model also makes novel predictions -- not made by conventional models -- that stand up to experimental test. Our model thus provides a better account of how neurons in the visual system interact with one another.},

@article{Garnier13,
	Abstract = {Interactions between individuals and the structure of their environment play a crucial role in shaping self-organized collective behaviors. Recent studies have shown that ants crossing asymmetrical bifurcations in a network of galleries tend to follow the branch that deviates the least from their incoming direction. At the collective level, the combination of this tendency and the pheromone-based recruitment results in a greater likelihood of selecting the shortest path between the colony's nest and a food source in a network containing asymmetrical bifurcations. It was not clear however what the origin of this behavioral bias is. Here we propose that it results from a simple interaction between the behavior of the ants and the geometry of the network, and that it does not require the ability to measure the angle of the bifurcation. We tested this hypothesis using groups of ant-like robots whose perceptual and cognitive abilities can be fully specified. We programmed them only to lay down and follow light trails, avoid obstacles and move according to a correlated random walk, but not to use more sophisticated orientation methods. We recorded the behavior of the robots in networks of galleries presenting either only symmetrical bifurcations or a combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical bifurcations. Individual robots displayed the same pattern of branch choice as individual ants when crossing a bifurcation, suggesting that ants do not actually measure the geometry of the bifurcations when travelling along a pheromone trail. Finally at the collective level, the group of robots was more likely to select one of the possible shorter paths between two designated areas when moving in an asymmetrical network, as observed in ants. This study reveals the importance of the shape of trail networks for foraging in ants and emphasizes the underestimated role of the geometrical properties of transportation networks in general. Most ant species form transportation networks, be they foraging trails linking food sources to the main colony or underground galleries connecting the different parts of the nest. As for human transportation networks (roads, airlines, etc.), the design and the placement of the connecting points (or nodes) dramatically affects the movement of individuals and hence the exchanges of material and information. In a previous study, we have shown that the geometrical configuration of these nodes (i.e., the angles between the different exiting branches) can affect the route followed by an ant in a network of galleries and, as a consequence, the efficiency of the pheromone-based recruitment toward a food source. Here we show that we can reproduce these results using ant-like robots with minimal perceptual and cognitive capabilities. We demonstrate that the simple interaction between the displacement of an ant and the geometrical configuration of the gallery network can greatly affect the foraging performances of the colony. This result increases our understanding of how workers move through structures built by ant colonies and more generally points toward possible improvements for the design of man-made transportation networks.},

	Abstract = {Psychophysical evidence in humans indicates that localization is different for stationary flashed and coherently moving objects. To address how the primary visual cortex represents object position we used a population approach that pools spiking activity of many neurones in cat area 17. In response to flashed stationary squares (0.4 deg) we obtained localized activity distributions in visual field coordinates, which we referred to as profiles across a 'population receptive field' ({PRF}). We here show how motion trajectories can be derived from activity across the {PRF} and how the representation of moving and flashed stimuli differs in position. We found that motion was represented by peaks of population activity that followed the stimulus with a speed-dependent lag. However, time-to-peak latencies were shorter by ∼16 ms compared to the population responses to stationary flashes. In addition, motion representation showed a directional bias, as latencies were more reduced for peripheral-to-central motion compared to the opposite direction. We suggest that a moving stimulus provides 'preactivation' that allows more rapid processing than for a single flash event.},

By rotating the fly on a stepper motor outside in a wooded area, and along an angular motion trajectory representative of natural flight, we stimulate the fly's visual system with input that approaches the natural situation. The neural response is analysed in the framework of information theory, using methods that are free from assumptions. We demonstrate that information about the motion trajectory increases as the light level increases over a natural range. This indicates that the fly's brain utilizes the increase in photon flux to extract more information from the photoreceptor array, suggesting that imprecision in neural signals is dominated by photon shot noise in the physical input, rather than by noise generated within the nervous system itself.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic causal model based upon neural field models of the Amari type. We consider the application of these models to non-invasive data, with a special focus on the mapping from source activity on the cortical surface to a single channel. We introduce a neural field model based upon the canonical microcircuit ({CMC}), in which neuronal populations are assigned to different cortical layers. We show that {DCM} can disambiguate between alternative (neural mass and field) models of cortical activity. However, unlike neural mass models, {DCM} with neural fields can address questions about neuronal microcircuitry and lateral interactions. This is because they are equipped with interlaminar connections and horizontal intra-laminar connections that are patchy in nature. These horizontal or lateral connections can be regarded as connecting macrocolumns with similar feature selectivity. Crucially, the spatial parameters governing horizontal connectivity determine the separation (width) of cortical macrocolumns. Thus we can estimate the width of macro columns, using non-invasive electromagnetic signals. We illustrate this estimation using dynamic causal models of steady-state or ongoing spectral activity measured using magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) in human visual cortex. Specifically, we revisit the hypothesis that the size of a macrocolumn is a key determinant of neuronal dynamics, particularly the peak gamma frequency. We are able to show a correlation, over subjects, between columnar size and peak gamma frequency --- that fits comfortably with established correlations between peak gamma frequency and the size of visual cortex defined retinotopically. We also considered cortical excitability and assessed its relative influence on observed gamma activity. This example highlights the potential utility of dynamic causal modelling and neural fields in providing quantitative characterisations of spatially extended dynamics on the cortical surface --- that are parameterised in terms of horizontal connections, implicit in the cortical micro-architecture and its synaptic parameters. \^{a}º New neural field model of canonical cortical microcircuitry \^{a}º Modelling of vertical interlaminar and horizontal intralaminar connections \^{a}º Estimation of the width of macrocolumns using non-invasive ({MEG}) signals \^{a}º Assessment of influence of cortical excitability and microcircuitry to gamma peak \^{a}º Mechanistic approach to correlations among cortical structure and function.},

@article{Fleming11,
	Abstract = {One of the main functions of vision is to estimate the {3D} shape of objects in our environment. Many different visual cues, such as stereopsis, motion parallax, and shading, are thought to be involved. One important cue that remains poorly understood comes from surface texture markings. When a textured surface is slanted in {3D} relative to the observer, the surface patterns appear compressed in the retinal image, providing potentially important information about {3D} shape. What is not known, however, is how the brain actually measures this information from the retinal image. Here, we explain how the key information could be extracted by populations of cells tuned to different orientations and spatial frequencies, like those found in the primary visual cortex. To test this theory, we created stimuli that selectively stimulate such cell populations, by '' smearing'' (filtering) images of {2D} random noise into specific oriented patterns. We find that the resulting patterns appear vividly {3D}, and that increasing the strength of the orientation signals progressively increases the sense of {3D} shape, even though the filtering we apply is physically inconsistent with what would occur with a real object. This finding suggests we have isolated key mechanisms used by the brain to estimate shape from texture. Crucially, we also find that adapting the visual system's orientation detectors to orthogonal patterns causes unoriented random noise to look like a specific {3D} shape. Together these findings demonstrate a crucial role of orientation detectors in the perception of {3D} shape.},

@article{Mouhot09,
	Abstract = {Going beyond the linearized study has been a longstanding problem in the theory of Landau damping. In this paper we establish exponential Landau damping in analytic regularity. The damping phenomenon is reinterpreted in terms of transfer of regularity between kinetic and spatial variables, rather than exchanges of energy; phase mixing is the driving mechanism. The analysis involves new families of analytic norms, measuring regularity by comparison with solutions of the free transport equation; new functional inequalities; a control of nonlinear echoes; sharp scattering estimates; and a Newton approximation scheme. Our results hold for any potential no more singular than Coulomb or Newton interaction; the limit cases are included with specific technical effort. As a side result, the stability of homogeneous equilibria of the nonlinear Vlasov equation is established under sharp assumptions. We point out the strong analogy with the {KAM} theory, and discuss physical implications.},

@article{Krauzlis04,
	Abstract = {Primates use a combination of smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements to stabilize the retinal image of selected objects within the high-acuity region near the fovea. Pursuit has traditionally been viewed as a relatively automatic behavior, driven by visual motion signals and mediated by pathways that connect visual areas in the cerebral cortex to motor regions in the cerebellum. However, recent findings indicate that this view needs to be reconsidered. Rather than being controlled primarily by areas in extrastriate cortex specialized for processing visual motion, pursuit involves an extended network of cortical areas, and, of these, the pursuit-related region in the frontal eye fields appears to exert the most direct influence. The traditional pathways through the cerebellum are important, but there are also newly identified routes involving structures previously associated with the control of saccades, including the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus, and nuclei in the brain stem reticular formation. These recent findings suggest that the pursuit system has a functional architecture very similar to that of the saccadic system. This viewpoint provides a new perspective on the processing steps that occur as descending control signals interact with circuits in the brain stem and cerebellum responsible for gating and executing voluntary eye movements. Although the traditional view describes pursuit and saccades as two distinct neural systems, it may be more accurate to consider the two movements as different outcomes from a shared cascade of sensory-motor functions.},

	Abstract = {Primates perform remarkably well in cognitive tasks such as pattern recognition. Motivated by recent findings in biological systems, a unified and consistent feedforward system network with a proper encoding scheme and supervised temporal rules is built for solving the pattern recognition task. The temporal rules used for processing precise spiking patterns have recently emerged as ways of emulating the brain's computation from its anatomy and physiology. Most of these rules could be used for recognizing different spatiotemporal patterns. However, there arises the question of whether these temporal rules could be used to recognize real-world stimuli such as images. Furthermore, how the information is represented in the brain still remains unclear. To tackle these problems, a proper encoding method and a unified computational model with consistent and efficient learning rule are proposed. Through encoding, external stimuli are converted into sparse representations, which also have properties of invariance. These temporal patterns are then learned through biologically derived algorithms in the learning layer, followed by the final decision presented through the readout layer. The performance of the model with images of digits from the {MNIST} database is presented. The results show that the proposed model is capable of recognizing images correctly with a performance comparable to that of current benchmark algorithms. The results also suggest a plausibility proof for a class of feedforward models of rapid and robust recognition in the brain.},

@article{Arrospide,
	Abstract = {Vehicle detection based on image analysis has attracted increasing attention in recent years due to its low cost, flexibility and potential towards collision avoidance. In particular, vehicle verification is especially challenging on account of the heterogeneity of vehicles in color, size, pose, etc. Imagebased vehicle verification is usually addressed as a supervised classification problem. Specifically, descriptors using Gabor filters have been reported to show good performance in this task. However, Gabor functions have a number of drawbacks relating to their frequency response. The main contribution of this paper is the proposal and evaluation of a new descriptor based on the alternative family of {log-Gabor} functions for vehicle verification, as opposed to existing Gabor filter based descriptors. These filters are theoretically superior to Gabor filters as they can represent better the frequency properties of natural images. As a second contribution, and in contrast to existing approaches, which transfer the standard configuration of filters used for other applications to the vehicle classification task, an in-depth analysis of the required filter configuration by both Gabor and {log-Gabor} descriptors for this particular application is performed for fair comparison. The extensive experiments conducted in this study confirm that the proposed {log-Gabor} descriptor significantly outperforms the standard Gabor filter for image-based vehicle verification.},

	Abstract = {The distribution of in vivo average firing rates within local cortical networks has been reported to be highly skewed and long tailed. The distribution of average single-cell inputs, conversely, is expected to be Gaussian by the central limit theorem. This raises the issue of how a skewed distribution of firing rates might result from a symmetric distribution of inputs. We argue that skewed rate distributions are a signature of the nonlinearity of the in vivo {f--I} curve. During in vivo conditions, ongoing synaptic activity produces significant fluctuations in the membrane potential of neurons, resulting in an expansive nonlinearity of the {f--I} curve for low and moderate inputs. Here, we investigate the effects of single-cell and network parameters on the shape of the {f--I} curve and, by extension, on the distribution of firing rates in randomly connected networks.},

@article{Clune13,
	Abstract = {A central biological question is how natural organisms are so evolvable (capable of quickly adapting to new environments). A key driver of evolvability is the widespread modularity of biological networks---their organization as functional, sparsely connected subunits---but there is no consensus regarding why modularity itself evolved. Although most hypotheses assume indirect selection for evolvability, here we demonstrate that the ubiquitous, direct selection pressure to reduce the cost of connections between network nodes causes the emergence of modular networks. Computational evolution experiments with selection pressures to maximize network performance and minimize connection costs yield networks that are significantly more modular and more evolvable than control experiments that only select for performance. These results will catalyse research in numerous disciplines, such as neuroscience and genetics, and enhance our ability to harness evolution for engineering purposes.},

@article{Quaia13,
	Abstract = {Stereo matching, i.e., the matching by the visual system of corresponding parts of the images seen by the two eyes, is inherently a {2D} problem. To gain insights into how this operation is carried out by the visual system, we measured, in human subjects, the reflexive vergence eye movements elicited by the sudden presentation of stereo plaids. We found compelling evidence that the {2D} pattern disparity is computed by combining disparities first extracted within orientation selective channels. This neural computation takes 10--15 ms, and is carried out even when subjects perceive not a single plaid but rather two gratings in different depth planes (transparency). However, we found that {1D} disparities are not always effectively combined: When spatial frequency and contrast of the gratings are sufficiently different pattern disparity is not computed, a result that cannot be simply attributed to the transparency of such stimuli. Based on our results, we propose that a narrow-band implementation of the {IOC} (Intersection of Constraints) rule (Fennema and Thompson, 1979; Adelson and Movshon, 1982), preceded by cross-orientation suppression, underlies the extraction of pattern disparity.},

@article{Srinivasa13,
	Abstract = {This study describes a spiking model that self-organizes for stable formation and maintenance of orientation and ocular dominance maps in the visual cortex (V1). This self-organization process simulates three development phases: an early experience-independent phase, a late experience-independent phase and a subsequent refinement phase during which experience acts to shape the map properties. The ocular dominance maps that emerge accommodate the two sets of monocular inputs that arise from the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) to layer 4 of V1. The orientation selectivity maps that emerge feature well-developed iso-orientation domains and fractures. During the last two phases of development the orientation preferences at some locations appear to rotate continuously through \$\\pm\$180\$\\,^{\\circ}\$ along circular paths and referred to as pinwheel-like patterns but without any corresponding point discontinuities in the orientation gradient maps. The formation of these functional maps is driven by balanced excitatory and inhibitory currents that are established via synaptic plasticity based on spike timing for both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The stability and maintenance of the formed maps with continuous synaptic plasticity is enabled by homeostasis caused by inhibitory plasticity. However, a prolonged exposure to repeated stimuli does alter the formed maps over time due to plasticity. The results from this study suggest that continuous synaptic plasticity in both excitatory neurons and interneurons could play a critical role in the formation, stability, and maintenance of functional maps in the cortex.},

@article{Luczak13,
	Abstract = {The activity of neural populations is determined not only by sensory inputs but also by internally generated patterns. During quiet wakefulness, the brain produces spontaneous firing events that can spread over large areas of cortex and have been suggested to underlie processes such as memory recall and consolidation. Here we demonstrate a different role for spontaneous activity in sensory cortex: gating of sensory inputs. We show that population activity in rat auditory cortex is composed of transient 50--100 ms packets of spiking activity that occur irregularly during silence and sustained tone stimuli, but reliably at tone onset. Population activity within these packets had broadly consistent spatiotemporal structure, but the rate and also precise relative timing of action potentials varied between stimuli. Packet frequency varied with cortical state, with desynchronized state activity consistent with superposition of multiple overlapping packets. We suggest that such packets reflect the sporadic opening of a '' gate'' that allows auditory cortex to broadcast a representation of external sounds to other brain regions.},

@article{Qian13,
	Abstract = {Optimization models explain many aspects of biological goal-directed movements. However, most such models use a finite-horizon formulation, which requires a prefixed movement duration to define a cost function and solve the optimization problem. To predict movement duration, these models have to be run multiple times with different prefixed durations until an appropriate duration is found by trial and error. The constrained minimum time model directly predicts movement duration; however, it does not consider sensory feedback and is thus applicable only to open-loop movements. To address these problems, we analyzed and simulated an infinite-horizon optimal feedback control model, with linear plants, that contains both control-dependent and control-independent noise and optimizes steady-state accuracy and energetic costs per unit time. The model applies the steady-state estimator and controller continuously to guide an effector to, and keep it at, target position. As such, it integrates movement control and posture maintenance without artificially dividing them with a precise, prefixed time boundary. Movement pace is determined by the model parameters, and the duration is an emergent property with trial-to-trial variability. By considering the mean duration, we derived both the log and power forms of Fitts's law as different approximations of the model. Moreover, the model reproduces typically observed velocity profiles and occasional transient overshoots. For unbiased sensory feedback, the effector reaches the target without bias, in contrast to finite-horizon models that systematically undershoot target when energetic cost is considered. Finally, the model does not involve backward and forward sweeps in time, its stability is easily checked, and the same solution applies to movements of different initial conditions and distances. We argue that biological systems could use steady-state solutions as default control mechanisms and might seek additional optimization of transient costs when justified or demanded by task or context.},

	Abstract = {Decision making often involves the accumulation of information over time, but acquiring information typically comes at a cost. Little is known about the cost incurred by animals and humans for acquiring additional information from sensory variables due, for instance, to attentional efforts. Through a novel integration of diffusion models and dynamic programming, we were able to estimate the cost of making additional observations per unit of time from two monkeys and six humans in a reaction time ({RT}) random-dot motion discrimination task. Surprisingly, we find that the cost is neither zero nor constant over time, but for the animals and humans features a brief period in which it is constant but increases thereafter. In addition, we show that our theory accurately matches the observed reaction time distributions for each stimulus condition, the time-dependent choice accuracy both conditional on stimulus strength and independent of it, and choice accuracy and mean reaction times as a function of stimulus strength. The theory also correctly predicts that urgency signals in the brain should be independent of the difficulty, or stimulus strength, at each trial.},

@article{McCamy13,
	Abstract = {
                A large amount of classic and contemporary vision studies require subjects to fixate a target. Target fixation serves as a normalizing factor across studies, promoting the field's ability to compare and contrast experiments. Yet, fixation target parameters, including luminance, contrast, size, shape and color, vary across studies, potentially affecting the interpretation of results. Previous research on the effects of fixation target size and luminance on the control of fixation position rendered conflicting results, and no study has examined the effects of fixation target characteristics on square-wave jerks, the most common type of saccadic intrusion. Here we set out to determine the effects of fixation target size and luminance on the characteristics of microsaccades and square-wave jerks, over a large range of stimulus parameters. Human subjects fixated a circular target with varying luminance and size while we recorded their eye movements with an infrared video tracker ({EyeLink} 1000, {SR} Research). We detected microsaccades and {SWJs} automatically with objective algorithms developed previously. Microsaccade rates decreased linearly and microsaccade magnitudes increased linearly with target size. The percent of microsaccades forming part of {SWJs} decreased, and the time from the end of the initial {SWJ} saccade to the beginning of the second {SWJ} saccade ({SWJ} inter-saccadic interval; {ISI}) increased with target size. The microsaccadic preference for horizontal direction also decreased moderately with target size . Target luminance did not affect significantly microsaccades or {SWJs}, however. In the absence of a fixation target, microsaccades became scarcer and larger, while {SWJ} prevalence decreased and {SWJ} {ISIs} increased. Thus, the choice of fixation target can affect experimental outcomes, especially in human factors and in visual and oculomotor studies. These results have implications for previous and future research conducted under fixation conditions, and should encourage forthcoming studies to report the size of fixation targets to aid the interpretation and replication of their results.

	Abstract = {The cerebellum is a brain structure which has been traditionally devoted to supervised learning. According to this theory, plasticity at the Parallel Fiber ({PF}) to Purkinje Cell ({PC}) synapses is guided by the Climbing fibers ({CF}), which encode an 'error signal'. Purkinje cells have thus been modeled as perceptrons, learning input/output binary associations. At maximal capacity, a perceptron with excitatory weights expresses a large fraction of zero-weight synapses, in agreement with experimental findings. However, numerous experiments indicate that the firing rate of Purkinje cells varies in an analog, not binary, manner. In this paper, we study the perceptron with analog inputs and outputs. We show that the optimal input has a sparse binary distribution, in good agreement with the burst firing of the Granule cells. In addition, we show that the weight distribution consists of a large fraction of silent synapses, as in previously studied binary perceptron models, and as seen experimentally. Learning properties of neuronal networks have been extensively studied using methods from statistical physics. However, most of these studies ignore a fundamental constraint in networks of real neurons: synapses are either excitatory or inhibitory, and cannot change sign during learning. Here, we characterize the optimal storage properties of an analog perceptron with excitatory synapses, as a simplified model for cerebellar Purkinje cells. The information storage capacity is shown to be optimized when inputs have a sparse binary distribution, while the weight distribution at maximal capacity consists of a large amount of zero-weight synapses. Both features are in agreement with electrophysiological data.},

	Abstract = {The mismatch negativity ({MMN}) is a differential brain response to violations of learned regularities. It has been used to demonstrate that the brain learns the statistical structure of its environment and predicts future sensory inputs. However, the algorithmic nature of these computations and the underlying neurobiological implementation remain controversial. This article introduces a mathematical framework with which competing ideas about the computational quantities indexed by {MMN} responses can be formalized and tested against single-trial {EEG} data. This framework was applied to five major theories of the {MMN}, comparing their ability to explain trial-by-trial changes in {MMN} amplitude. Three of these theories (predictive coding, model adjustment, and novelty detection) were formalized by linking the {MMN} to different manifestations of the same computational mechanism: approximate Bayesian inference according to the free-energy principle. We thereby propose a unifying view on three distinct theories of the {MMN}. The relative plausibility of each theory was assessed against empirical single-trial {MMN} amplitudes acquired from eight healthy volunteers in a roving oddball experiment. Models based on the free-energy principle provided more plausible explanations of trial-by-trial changes in {MMN} amplitude than models representing the two more traditional theories (change detection and adaptation). Our results suggest that the {MMN} reflects approximate Bayesian learning of sensory regularities, and that the {MMN}-generating process adjusts a probabilistic model of the environment according to prediction errors.},

	Abstract = {
                Neuronal responses during sensory processing are influenced by both the organization of intracortical connections and the statistical features of sensory stimuli. How these intrinsic and extrinsic factors govern the activity of excitatory and inhibitory populations is unclear. Using two-photon calcium imaging in vivo and intracellular recordings in vitro, we investigated the dependencies between synaptic connectivity, feature selectivity and network activity in pyramidal cells and fast-spiking parvalbumin-expressing ({PV}) interneurons in mouse visual cortex. In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking {PV} cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities. Therefore, feedforward and recurrent network influences determine the activity of excitatory and inhibitory ensembles in fundamentally different ways.

@article{Guo07,
	Abstract = {In normal vision, visual scenes are predictable, as they are both spatially and temporally redundant. Evidence suggests that the visual system may use the spatio-temporal regularities of the external world, available in the retinal signal, to extract information from the visual environment and better reconstruct current and future stimuli. We studied this by recording neuronal responses of primary visual cortex (area V1) in anaesthetized and paralysed macaques during the presentation of dynamic sequences of bars, in which spatio-temporal regularities and local information were independently manipulated. Most V1 neurons were significantly modulated by events prior to and distant from stimulation of their classical receptive fields ({CRFs}); many were more strongly tuned to prior and distant events than they were to {CRFs} bars; and several showed tuning to prior information without any {CRF} stimulation. Hence, V1 neurons do not simply analyse local contours, but impute local features to the visual world, on the basis of prior knowledge of a visual world in which useful information can be distributed widely in space and time.},

@article{Chossat09,
	Abstract = {We propose to use bifurcation theory and pattern formation as theoretical probes for various hypotheses about the neural organization of the brain. This allows us to make predictions about the kinds of patterns that should be observed in the activity of real brains through, e.g., optical imaging, and opens the door to the design of experiments to test these hypotheses. We study the specific problem of visual edges and textures perception and suggest that these features may be represented at the population level in the visual cortex as a specific second-order tensor, the structure tensor, perhaps within a hypercolumn. We then extend the classical ring model to this case and show that its natural framework is the {non-Euclidean} hyperbolic geometry. This brings in the beautiful structure of its group of isometries and certain of its subgroups which have a direct interpretation in terms of the organization of the neural populations that are assumed to encode the structure tensor. By studying the bifurcations of the solutions of the structure tensor equations, the analog of the classical Wilson and Cowan equations, under the assumption of invariance with respect to the action of these subgroups, we predict the appearance of characteristic patterns. These patterns can be described by what we call hyperbolic or H-planforms that are reminiscent of Euclidean planar waves and of the planforms that were used in previous work to account for some visual hallucinations. If these patterns could be observed through brain imaging techniques they would reveal the built-in or acquired invariance of the neural organization to the action of the corresponding subgroups. Our visual perception of the world is remarkably stable despite the fact that we move our gaze and body. This must be the effect of the neuronal organization of the visual areas of our brains that succeed in maintaining in our consciouness a representation that seems to be protected from brutal variations. We propose a theory to account for an invariance that pertains to such image features as edges and textures. It is based on the simple assumption that the spatial variations of the image intensity, its derivatives, are extracted and represented in some visual brain areas by populations of neurons that excite and inhibit each other according to the values of these derivatives. Geometric transformations of the retinal image, caused say by eye movements, affect these derivatives. Assuming that their representations are invariant to these transformations, we predict the appearance of specific patterns of activity which we call hyperbolic planforms. It is surprising that the geometry that emerges from our investigations is not the usual Euclidean geometry but the much less familiar hyperbolic, {non-Euclidean}, geometry. We also propose some preliminary ideas for putting our theory to the test by actual measurements of brain activity.},

	Abstract = {Decorrelation is a fundamental computation that optimizes the format of neuronal activity patterns. Channel decorrelation by adaptive mechanisms results in efficient coding, whereas pattern decorrelation facilitates the readout and storage of information. Mechanisms achieving pattern decorrelation, however, remain unclear. We developed a theoretical framework that relates high-dimensional pattern decorrelation to neuronal and circuit properties in a mathematically stringent fashion. For a generic class of random neuronal networks, we proved that pattern decorrelation emerges from neuronal nonlinearities and is amplified by recurrent connectivity. This mechanism does not require adaptation of the network, is enhanced by sparse connectivity, depends on the baseline membrane potential and is robust. Connectivity measurements and computational modeling suggest that this mechanism is involved in pattern decorrelation in the zebrafish olfactory bulb. These results reveal a generic relationship between the structure and function of neuronal circuits that is probably relevant for pattern processing in various brain areas.},

	Abstract = {
                The juxtaposition of established signal detection theory models of perception and more recent claims about the encoding of uncertainty in perception is a rich source of confusion. Are the latter simply a rehash of the former? Here, we make an attempt to distinguish precisely between optimal and probabilistic computation. In optimal computation, the observer minimizes the expected cost under a posterior probability distribution. In probabilistic computation, the observer uses higher moments of the likelihood function of the stimulus on a trial-by-trial basis. Computation can be optimal without being probabilistic, and vice versa. Most signal detection theory models describe optimal computation. Behavioral data only provide evidence for a neural representation of uncertainty if they are best described by a model of probabilistic computation. We argue that single-neuron activity sometimes suffices for optimal computation, but never for probabilistic computation. A population code is needed instead. Not every population code is equally suitable, because nuisance parameters have to be marginalized out. This problem is solved by Poisson-like, but not by Gaussian variability. Finally, we build a dictionary between signal detection theory quantities and Poisson-like population quantities.

In most situations, the optimal strategy for decoding the population signal is to compute the likelihoods of the stimuli that are consistent with an observed neural response. But it has not been clear how the brain can directly compute likelihoods. Here we present a simple and biologically plausible model that can realize the likelihood function by computing a weighted sum of sensory neuron responses.

	Abstract = {This chapter addresses three different aspects related to visual motion processing by means of second-order motion stimuli. The first question discussed is whether there is a need for separate mechanisms underlying the execution of action and perception elicited by these motion stimuli. Second, light is shed on the neuronal responses to second-order motion stimuli recorded from the middle temporal ({MT}) and medial superior temporal ({MST}) areas. While neuronal responses are recorded, the monkeys performed a psychophysical task and reported the direction of stimulus movements. Third and final, the perception of biological motion in man and monkeys and its relationship to second-order motion is addressed.},

@article{Gidon12,
	Abstract = {Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in shaping the dynamics of neuronal networks and selecting cell assemblies. Typically, an inhibitory axon contacts a particular dendritic subdomain of its target neuron, where it often makes 10--20 synapses, sometimes on very distal branches. The functional implications of such a connectivity pattern are not well understood. Our experimentally based theoretical study highlights several new and counterintuitive principles for dendritic inhibition. We show that distal '' off-path'' rather than proximal '' on-path'' inhibition effectively dampens proximal excitable dendritic '' hotspots,'' thus powerfully controlling the neuron's output. Additionally, with multiple synaptic contacts, inhibition operates globally, spreading centripetally hundreds of micrometers from the inhibitory synapses. Consequently, inhibition in regions lacking inhibitory synapses may exceed that at the synaptic sites themselves. These results offer new insights into the synergetic effect of dendritic inhibition in controlling dendritic excitability and plasticity and in dynamically molding functional dendritic subdomains and their output. \^{a}º Distal dendritic inhibition effectively controls excitability at proximal regions \^{a}º Inhibitory shunt spreads centripetally in dendrites encircled by multiple I-synapses \^{a}º Maximal inhibition may occur in dendritic domains lacking I-synapses \^{a}º A small number of I-synapses can effectively inhibit the entire dendritic tree},

@article{Osborne09,
	Abstract = {To probe how the brain integrates visual motion signals to guide behavior, we analyzed the smooth pursuit eye movements evoked by target motion with a stochastic component. When each dot of a texture executed an independent random walk such that speed or direction varied across the spatial extent of the target, pursuit variance increased as a function of the variance of visual pattern motion. Noise in either target direction or speed increased the variance of both eye speed and direction, implying a common neural noise source for estimating target speed and direction. Spatial averaging was inefficient for targets with >20 dots. Together these data suggest that pursuit performance is limited by the properties of spatial averaging across a noisy population of sensory neurons rather than across the physical stimulus. When targets executed a spatially uniform random walk in time around a central direction of motion, an optimized linear filter that describes the transformation of target motion into eye motion accounted for ∼50\% of the variance in pursuit. Filters had widths of ∼25 ms, much longer than the impulse response of the eye, and filter shape depended on both the range and correlation time of motion signals, suggesting that filters were products of sensory processing. By quantifying the effects of different levels of stimulus noise on pursuit, we have provided rigorous constraints for understanding sensory population decoding. We have shown how temporal and spatial integration of sensory signals converts noisy population responses into precise motor responses.},

@article{Gerhard13,
	Abstract = {A key hypothesis in sensory system neuroscience is that sensory representations are adapted to the statistical regularities in sensory signals and thereby incorporate knowledge about the outside world. Supporting this hypothesis, several probabilistic models of local natural image regularities have been proposed that reproduce neural response properties. Although many such physiological links have been made, these models have not been linked directly to visual sensitivity. Previous psychophysical studies of sensitivity to natural image regularities focus on global perception of large images, but much less is known about sensitivity to local natural image regularities. We present a new paradigm for controlled psychophysical studies of local natural image regularities and compare how well such models capture perceptually relevant image content. To produce stimuli with precise statistics, we start with a set of patches cut from natural images and alter their content to generate a matched set whose joint statistics are equally likely under a probabilistic natural image model. The task is forced choice to discriminate natural patches from model patches. The results show that human observers can learn to discriminate the higher-order regularities in natural images from those of model samples after very few exposures and that no current model is perfect for patches as small as 5 by 5 pixels or larger. Discrimination performance was accurately predicted by model likelihood, an information theoretic measure of model efficacy, indicating that the visual system possesses a surprisingly detailed knowledge of natural image higher-order correlations, much more so than current image models. We also perform three cue identification experiments to interpret how model features correspond to perceptually relevant image features. Several aspects of primate visual physiology have been identified as adaptations to local regularities of natural images. However, much less work has measured visual sensitivity to local natural image regularities. Most previous work focuses on global perception of large images and shows that observers are more sensitive to visual information when image properties resemble those of natural images. In this work we measure human sensitivity to local natural image regularities using stimuli generated by patch-based probabilistic natural image models that have been related to primate visual physiology. We find that human observers can learn to discriminate the statistical regularities of natural image patches from those represented by current natural image models after very few exposures and that discriminability depends on the degree of regularities captured by the model. The quick learning we observed suggests that the human visual system is biased for processing natural images, even at very fine spatial scales, and that it has a surprisingly large knowledge of the regularities in natural images, at least in comparison to the state-of-the-art statistical models of natural images.},

	Abstract = {One important aspect of the functional architecture of primary visual cortex is the circuitry that accounts for the receptive field properties of neurons. The anatomy that underlies retinotopy and ocular dominance is well known, but no anatomical structure related to orientation selectivity has been found in primates. We examined whether the arrangement of local axon systems projecting within the cortical layers might be correlated with orientation preference in New World monkeys. We found that axons in layer 3 spread out from the site of a tracer injection in an anisotropic manner and that this elongated distribution is aligned with the preferred orientation recorded at each site. Moreover, within a few degrees of the foveal representation, the majority of the axon terminals fall within or just outside of the limits of the cortical mapping of the classical receptive field. Thus local axons produce a field of monosynaptic excitation that aligns with orientation axes and reaches neurons that have receptive fields which are adjacent in visual space.},

@article{Wilming13,
	Abstract = {The interest in saccadic {IOR} is funneled by the hypothesis that it serves a clear functional purpose in the selection of fixation points: the facilitation of foraging. In this study, we arrive at a different interpretation of saccadic {IOR}. First, we find that return saccades are performed much more often than expected from the statistical properties of saccades and saccade pairs. Second, we find that fixation durations before a saccade are modulated by the relative angle of the saccade, but return saccades show no sign of an additional temporal inhibition. Thus, we do not find temporal saccadic inhibition of return. Interestingly, we find that return locations are more salient, according to empirically measured saliency (locations that are fixated by many observers) as well as stimulus dependent saliency (defined by image features), than regular fixation locations. These results and the finding that return saccades increase the match of individual trajectories with a grand total priority map evidences the return saccades being part of a fixation selection strategy that trades off exploration and exploitation. Sometimes humans look at the same location twice. To appreciate the importance of this inconspicuous statement you have to consider that we move our eyes several billion (109) times during our lives and that looking at something is a necessary condition to enable conscious visual awareness. Thus, understanding why and how we move our eyes provides a window into our mental life. Here we investigate one heavily discussed aspect of human's fixation selection strategy: whether it inhibits returning to previously fixated locations. We analyze a large data set (more than 550,000 fixations from 235 subjects) and find that, returning to previously fixated locations happens much more often than expected from the statistical properties of eye-movement trajectories. Furthermore, those locations that we return to are not ordinary -- they are more salient than locations that we do not return to. Thus, the inconspicuous statement that we look at the same locations twice reveals an important aspect of our strategy to select fixation points: That we trade off exploring our environment against making sure that we have fully comprehended the relevant parts of our environment.},

@article{Ito04,
	Abstract = {Angles and junctions embedded within contours are important features to represent the shape of objects. To study the neuronal basis to extract these features, we conducted extracellular recordings while two macaque monkeys performed a fixation task. Angle stimuli were the combination of two straight half-lines larger than the size of the classical receptive fields ({CRFs}). Each line was drawn from the center to outside the {CRFs} in 1 of 12 directions, so that the stimuli passed through the {CRFs} and formed angles at the center of the {CRFs}. Of 114 neurons recorded from the superficial layer of area V2, 91 neurons showed selective responses to these angle stimuli. Of these, 41 neurons (36.0\%) showed selective responses to wide angles between 60\$\\,^{\\circ}\$ and 150\$\\,^{\\circ}\$ that were distinct from responses to straight lines or sharp angles (30\$\\,^{\\circ}\$). Responses were highly selective to a particular angle in approximately one-fourth of neurons. When we tested the selectivity of the same neurons to individual half-lines, the preferred direction was more or less consistent with one or two components of the optimal angle stimuli. These results suggest that the selectivity of the neurons depends on both the combination of two components and the responses to individual components. Angle-selective V2 neurons are unlikely to be specific angle detectors, because the magnitude of their responses to the optimal angle was indistinguishable from that to the optimal half-lines. We suggest that the extraction of information of angles embedded within contour stimuli may start in area V2.},

To elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying contour and texture processing, we examined receptive field ({RF}) structures of neurons in visual area V2 of the macaque monkey for encoding combinations of orientations. By measuring orientation tuning at several locations within the classical {RF}, we found that a majority (70\%) of V2 neurons have similar orientation tuning throughout the {RF}. However, many others have {RFs} containing subregions tuned to different orientations, most commonly about 90 degrees apart. By measuring interactions between two positions within the {RF}, we found that approximately one-third of neurons show inhibitory interactions that make them selective for combinations of orientations. These results indicate that V2 neurons could play an important role in analyzing contours and textures and could provide useful cues for surface segmentation.},

	Abstract = {Many studies have reported long-range synchronization of neuronal activity between brain areas, in particular in the beta and gamma bands with frequencies in the range of 14-30 and 40-80 Hz, respectively. Several studies have reported synchrony with zero phase lag, which is remarkable considering the synaptic and conduction delays inherent in the connections between distant brain areas. This result has led to many speculations about the possible functional role of zero-lag synchrony, such as for neuronal communication, attention, memory, and feature binding. However, recent studies using recordings of single-unit activity and local field potentials report that neuronal synchronization may occur with non-zero phase lags. This raises the questions whether zero-lag synchrony can occur in the brain and, if so, under which conditions. We used analytical methods and computer simulations to investigate which connectivity between neuronal populations allows or prohibits zero-lag synchrony. We did so for a model where two oscillators interact via a relay oscillator. Analytical results and computer simulations were obtained for both type I {Mirollo-Strogatz} neurons and type {II} {Hodgkin-Huxley} neurons. We have investigated the dynamics of the model for various types of synaptic coupling and importantly considered the potential impact of {Spike-Timing} Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}) and its learning window. We confirm previous results that zero-lag synchrony can be achieved in this configuration. This is much easier to achieve with {Hodgkin-Huxley} neurons, which have a biphasic phase response curve, than for type I neurons. {STDP} facilitates zero-lag synchrony as it adjusts the synaptic strengths such that zero-lag synchrony is feasible for a much larger range of parameters than without {STDP}.},

@article{Vetter12,
	Abstract = {Predicting visual information facilitates efficient processing of visual signals. Higher visual areas can support the processing of incoming visual information by generating predictive models that are fed back to lower visual areas. Functional brain imaging has previously shown that predictions interact with visual input already at the level of the primary visual cortex (V1; Harrison et al., 2007; Alink et al., 2010). Given that fixation changes up to four times a second in natural viewing conditions, cortical predictions are effective in V1 only if they are fed back in time for the processing of the next stimulus and at the corresponding new retinotopic position. Here, we tested whether spatio-temporal predictions are updated before, during, or shortly after an inter-hemifield saccade is executed, and thus, whether the predictive signal is transferred swiftly across hemifields. Using an apparent motion illusion, we induced an internal motion model that is known to produce a spatio-temporal prediction signal along the apparent motion trace in V1 (Muckli et al., 2005; Alink et al., 2010). We presented participants with both visually predictable and unpredictable targets on the apparent motion trace. During the task, participants saccaded across the illusion whilst detecting the target. As found previously, predictable stimuli were detected more frequently than unpredictable stimuli. Furthermore, we found that the detection advantage of predictable targets is detectable as early as 50-100 ms after saccade offset. This result demonstrates the rapid nature of the transfer of a spatio-temporally precise predictive signal across hemifields, in a paradigm previously shown to modulate V1.},

	Abstract = {If modern computers are sometimes superior to cognition in some specialized tasks such as playing chess or browsing a large database, they can't beat the efficiency of biological vision for such simple tasks as recognizing a relative or following an object in a complex background. We present in this paper our attempt at outlining the dynamical, parallel and event-based representation for vision in the architecture of the central nervous system. We will illustrate this by showing that in a signal matching framework, a {L/LN} (linear/non-linear) cascade may efficiently transform a sensory signal into a neural spiking signal and we apply this framework to a model retina. However, this code gets redundant when using an over-complete basis as is necessary for modeling the primary visual cortex: we therefore optimize the efficiency cost by increasing the sparseness of the code. This is implemented by propagating and canceling redundant information using lateral interactions. We compare the efficiency of this representation in terms of compression as the reconstruction quality as a function of the coding length. This will correspond to a modification of the Matching Pursuit algorithm where the {ArgMax} function is optimized for competition, or Competition Optimized Matching Pursuit ({COMP}). We will particularly focus on bridging neuroscience and image processing and on the advantages of such an interdisciplinary approach.},

	Abstract = {To understand possible strategies of temporal spike coding in the central nervous system, we study functional neuromimetic models of visual processing for static images. We will first present the retinal model which was introduced by Van Rullen and Thorpe [1] and which represents the multi- scale contrast values of the image using an orthonormal wavelet transform. These analog values activate a set of spiking neurons which each fire once to produce an asynchronous wave of spikes. According to this model, the image may be progressively reconstructed from this spike wave thanks to regularities in the statistics of the coefficients determined with natural images. Here, we study mathematically how the quality of information transmission carried by this temporal representation varies over time. In particular, we study how these regularities can be used to optimize information transmission by using a form of temporal cooperation of neurons to code analog values. The original model used wavelet transforms that are close to orthogonal. However, the selectivity of realistic neurons overlap, and we propose an extension of the previous model by adding a spatial cooperation between filters. This model extends the previous scheme for arbitrary ---and possibly non-orthogonal--- representations of features in the images. In particular, we compared the perfor- mance of increasingly over-complete representations in the retina. Results show that this algorithm provides an efficient spike coding strategy for low-level visual processing which may adapt to the complexity of the visual input.},

@article{Seghier13,
	Abstract = {In this work, we address the problem of using dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) to estimate the coupling parameters (effective connectivity) of large models with many regions. This is a potentially important problem because meaningful graph theoretic analyses of effective connectivity rest upon the statistics of the connections (edges). This calls for characterisations of networks with an appreciable number of regions (nodes). The problem here is that the number of coupling parameters grows quadratically with the number of nodes---leading to severe conditional dependencies among their estimates and a computational load that quickly becomes unsustainable. Here, we describe a simple solution, in which we use functional connectivity to provide prior constraints that bound the effective number of free parameters. In brief, we assume that priors over connections between individual nodes can be replaced by priors over connections between modes (patterns over nodes). By using a small number of modes, we can reduce the dimensionality of the problem in an informed way. The modes we use are the principal components or eigenvectors of the functional connectivity matrix. However, this approach begs the question of how many modes to use. This question can be addressed using Bayesian model comparison to optimise the number of modes. We imagine that this form of prior -- over the extrinsic (endogenous) connections in large {DCMs} -- may be useful for people interested in applying graph theory to distributed networks in the brain or to characterise connectivity beyond the subgraphs normally examined in {DCM}. \^{a}º Here we investigate the possibility to invert large {DCMs} with many regions. \^{a}º To do that, we place constraints on priors to bind the number of free parameters. \^{a}º Constraints are provided by the principal modes of the functional connectivity. \^{a}º Bayesian model comparison is used to identify the optimal number of modes. \^{a}º The ability to invert large {DCMs} provides a new opportunity for graph theory users.},

A large variety of diseases affect the vasculature, in ways that may cause geometrical and functional changes. Retinal images are therefore not only suitable for investigation of ocular diseases such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration ({AMD}), but also for systemic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arteriosclerosis. This paper presents a novel method for retinal vasculature extraction, using a vessel tracking method based on multi-orientation analysis. We apply multi-orientation analysis via so-called invertible orientation scores, modeling the cortical columns in the visual system of higher mammals. This allows us to successfully deal with the many complex problems inherent to vasculature tracking, such as tracking over crossings, bifurcations, parallel tracks and tracks of varying widths. The method runs fully automatically and provides a detailed model of the retinal vasculature, which is crucial as a sound basis for further quantitative analysis of the retina, especially in screening applications.},

@article{Zheng13,
	Abstract = {The information processing abilities of neural circuits arise from their synaptic connection patterns. Understanding the laws governing these connectivity patterns is essential for understanding brain function. The overall distribution of synaptic strengths of local excitatory connections in cortex and hippocampus is long-tailed, exhibiting a small number of synaptic connections of very large efficacy. At the same time, new synaptic connections are constantly being created and individual synaptic connection strengths show substantial fluctuations across time. It remains unclear through what mechanisms these properties of neural circuits arise and how they contribute to learning and memory. In this study we show that fundamental characteristics of excitatory synaptic connections in cortex and hippocampus can be explained as a consequence of self-organization in a recurrent network combining spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}), structural plasticity and different forms of homeostatic plasticity. In the network, associative synaptic plasticity in the form of {STDP} induces a rich-get-richer dynamics among synapses, while homeostatic mechanisms induce competition. Under distinctly different initial conditions, the ensuing self-organization produces long-tailed synaptic strength distributions matching experimental findings. We show that this self-organization can take place with a purely additive {STDP} mechanism and that multiplicative weight dynamics emerge as a consequence of network interactions. The observed patterns of fluctuation of synaptic strengths, including elimination and generation of synaptic connections and long-term persistence of strong connections, are consistent with the dynamics of dendritic spines found in rat hippocampus. Beyond this, the model predicts an approximately power-law scaling of the lifetimes of newly established synaptic connection strengths during development. Our results suggest that the combined action of multiple forms of neuronal plasticity plays an essential role in the formation and maintenance of cortical circuits. The computations that brain circuits can perform depend on their wiring. While a wiring diagram is still out of reach for major brain structures such as the neocortex and hippocampus, data on the overall distribution of synaptic connection strengths and the temporal fluctuations of individual synapses have recently become available. Specifically, there exists a small population of very strong and stable synaptic connections, which may form the physiological substrate of life-long memories. This population coexists with a big and ever changing population of much smaller and strongly fluctuating synaptic connections. So far it has remained unclear how these properties of networks in neocortex and hippocampus arise. Here we present a computational model that explains these fundamental properties of neural circuits as a consequence of network self-organization resulting from the combined action of different forms of neuronal plasticity. This self-organization is driven by a rich-get-richer effect induced by an associative synaptic learning mechanism which is kept in check by several homeostatic plasticity mechanisms stabilizing the network. The model highlights the role of self-organization in the formation of brain circuits and parsimoniously explains a range of recent findings about their fundamental properties.},

Here we show that curved motion, as employed by the magician in a classic sleight of hand trick, generates stronger misdirection than rectilinear motion, and that this difference can be explained by the differential engagement of the smooth pursuit and the saccadic oculomotor systems. This research exemplifies how the magician's intuitive understanding of the spectator's mindset can surpass that of the cognitive scientist in specific instances, and that observation-based behavioral insights developed by magicians are worthy of quantitative investigation in the neuroscience laboratory.},

	Abstract = {The sandfish lizard (Scincus scincus) swims within granular media (sand) using axial body undulations to propel itself without the use of limbs. In previous work we predicted average swimming speed by developing a numerical simulation that incorporated experimentally measured biological kinematics into a multibody sandfish model. The model was coupled to an experimentally validated soft sphere discrete element method simulation of the granular medium. In this paper, we use the simulation to study the detailed mechanics of undulatory swimming in a '' granular frictional fluid'' and compare the predictions to our previously developed resistive force theory ({RFT}) which models sand-swimming using empirically determined granular drag laws. The simulation reveals that the forward speed of the center of mass ({CoM}) oscillates about its average speed in antiphase with head drag. The coupling between overall body motion and body deformation results in a non-trivial pattern in the magnitude of lateral displacement of the segments along the body. The actuator torque and segment power are maximal near the center of the body and decrease to zero toward the head and the tail. Approximately 30\% of the net swimming power is dissipated in head drag. The power consumption is proportional to the frequency in the biologically relevant range, which confirms that frictional forces dominate during sand-swimming by the sandfish. Comparison of the segmental forces measured in simulation with the force on a laterally oscillating rod reveals that a granular hysteresis effect causes the overestimation of the body thrust forces in the {RFT}. Our models provide detailed testable predictions for biological locomotion in a granular environment. The sandfish lizard uses body undulation to propel itself within granular media (sand). Previously we developed a numerical simulation model consisting of an experimentally validated multi-particle model of the granular medium, and a sandfish model with prescribed body deformation (a traveling sinusoidal wave with parameters measured from biological experiment). We used the simulation to capture average swimming speed and compared predictions to our previously developed resistive force theory ({RFT}) for granular media. In this paper, we use the numerical model to perform more detailed analysis of the mechanics of sand-swimming in a so-called '' granular frictional fluid''. These include center-of-mass kinematics, force distributions along the body, effects of body and head shape, power generation and dissipation. We discuss how these aspects of sand-swimming compare to those for swimmers (like nematodes and eels) in true fluids. We use the numerical model to reveal how transients during start-up in granular drag generates discrepancies between the simulation and the {RFT} predictions. The predictions from our models can give insight into locomotor capabilities, musculoskeletal structure and morphological features of sand-swimming animals. These results may also provide guidance for the design and control of sand-swimming robots.},

	Abstract = {Accurate models of synaptic plasticity are essential to understand the adaptive properties of the nervous system and for realistic models of learning and memory. Experiments have shown that synaptic plasticity depends not only on pre- and post-synaptic activity patterns, but also on the strength of the connection itself. Namely, weaker synapses are more easily strengthened than already strong ones. This so called soft-bound plasticity automatically constrains the synaptic strengths. It is known that this has important consequences for the dynamics of plasticity and the synaptic weight distribution, but its impact on information storage is unknown. In this modeling study we introduce an information theoretic framework to analyse memory storage in an online learning setting. We show that soft-bound plasticity increases a variety of performance criteria by about 18\% over hard-bound plasticity, and likely maximizes the storage capacity of synapses. It is generally believed that our memories are stored in the synaptic connections between neurons. Numerous experimental studies have therefore examined when and how the synaptic connections change. In parallel, many computational studies have examined the properties of memory and synaptic plasticity, aiming to better understand human memory and allow for neural network models of the brain. However, the plasticity rules used in most studies are highly simplified and do not take into account the rich behaviour found in experiments. For instance, it has been observed in experiments that it is hard to make strong synapses even stronger. Here we show that this saturation of plasticity enhances the number of memories that can be stored and introduce a general framework to calculate information storage in online learning paradigms.},

@article{Liu08,
	Abstract = {
                Perception involves two types of decisions about the sensory world: identification of stimulus features as analog quantities, or discrimination of the same stimulus features among a set of discrete alternatives. Veridical judgment and categorical discrimination have traditionally been conceptualized as two distinct computational problems. Here, we found that these two types of decision making can be subserved by a shared cortical circuit mechanism. We used a continuous recurrent network model to simulate two monkey experiments in which subjects were required to make either a two-alternative forced choice or a veridical judgment about the direction of random-dot motion. The model network is endowed with a continuum of bell-shaped population activity patterns, each representing a possible motion direction. Slow recurrent excitation underlies accumulation of sensory evidence, and its interplay with strong recurrent inhibition leads to decision behaviors. The model reproduced the monkey's performance as well as single-neuron activity in the categorical discrimination task. Furthermore, we examined how direction identification is determined by a combination of sensory stimulation and microstimulation. Using a population-vector measure, we found that direction judgments instantiate winner-take-all (with the population vector coinciding with either the coherent motion direction or the electrically elicited motion direction) when two stimuli are far apart, or vector averaging (with the population vector falling between the two directions) when two stimuli are close to each other. Interestingly, for a broad range of intermediate angular distances between the two stimuli, the network displays a mixed strategy in the sense that direction estimates are stochastically produced by winner-take-all on some trials and by vector averaging on the other trials, a model prediction that is experimentally testable. This work thus lends support to a common neurodynamic framework for both veridical judgment and categorical discrimination in perceptual decision making.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present a new variational method for sparse regression using \\$L\_0\\$ regularization. The variational parameters appear in the approximate model in a way that is similar to Breiman's Garrote model. We refer to this method as the variational Garrote ({VG}). We show that the combination of the variational approximation and \\$L\_0\\$ regularization has the effect of making the problem effectively of maximal rank even when the number of samples is small compared to the number of variables. The {VG} is compared numerically with the Lasso method, ridge regression and the recently introduced paired mean field method ({PMF}) (M. Titsias \&amp; M. {L\'{a}zaro-Gredilla}., {NIPS} 2012). Numerical results show that the {VG} and {PMF} yield more accurate predictions and more accurately reconstruct the true model than the other methods. It is shown that the {VG} finds correct solutions when the Lasso solution is inconsistent due to large input correlations. Globally, {VG} is significantly faster than {PMF} and tends to perform better as the problems become denser and in problems with strongly correlated inputs. The naive implementation of the {VG} scales cubic with the number of features. By introducing Lagrange multipliers we obtain a dual formulation of the problem that scales cubic in the number of samples, but close to linear in the number of features.},

@article{Yang12,
	Abstract = {Sensory-motor behavior results from a complex interaction of noisy sensory data with priors based on recent experience. By varying the stimulus form and contrast for the initiation of smooth pursuit eye movements in monkeys, we show that visual motion inputs compete with two independent priors: one prior biases eye speed toward zero; the other prior attracts eye direction according to the past several days' history of target directions. The priors bias the speed and direction of the initiation of pursuit for the weak sensory data provided by the motion of a low-contrast sine wave grating. However, the priors have relatively little effect on pursuit speed and direction when the visual stimulus arises from the coherent motion of a high-contrast patch of dots. For any given stimulus form, the mean and variance of eye speed covary in the initiation of pursuit, as expected for signal-dependent noise. This relationship suggests that pursuit implements a trade-off between movement accuracy and variation, reducing both when the sensory signals are noisy. The tradeoff is implemented as a competition of sensory data and priors that follows the rules of Bayesian estimation. Computer simulations show that the priors can be understood as direction-specific control of the strength of visual-motor transmission, and can be implemented in a neural-network model that makes testable predictions about the population response in the smooth eye movement region of the frontal eye fields.},

	Abstract = {Daily life continually confronts us with an exuberance of external, sensory stimuli competing with a rich stream of internal deliberations, plans and ruminations. The brain must select one or more of these for further processing. How this competition is resolved across multiple sensory and cognitive regions is not known; nor is it clear how internal thoughts and attention regulate this competition. Recording from single neurons in patients implanted with intracranial electrodes for clinical reasons, here we demonstrate that humans can regulate the activity of their neurons in the medial temporal lobe ({MTL}) to alter the outcome of the contest between external images and their internal representation. Subjects looked at a hybrid superposition of two images representing familiar individuals, landmarks, objects or animals and had to enhance one image at the expense of the other, competing one. Simultaneously, the spiking activity of their {MTL} neurons in different subregions and hemispheres was decoded in real time to control the content of the hybrid. Subjects reliably regulated, often on the first trial, the firing rate of their neurons, increasing the rate of some while simultaneously decreasing the rate of others. They did so by focusing onto one image, which gradually became clearer on the computer screen in front of their eyes, and thereby overriding sensory input. On the basis of the firing of these {MTL} neurons, the dynamics of the competition between visual images in the subject's mind was visualized on an external display.},

	Abstract = {Sensory neurons have been hypothesized to efficiently encode signals from the natural environment subject to resource constraints. The predictions of this efficient coding hypothesis regarding the spatial filtering properties of the visual system have been found consistent with human perception, but they have not been compared directly with neural responses. Here, we analyze the information that retinal ganglion cells transmit to the brain about the spatial information in natural images subject to three resource constraints: the number of retinal ganglion cells, their total response variances, and their total synaptic strengths. We derive a model that optimizes the transmitted information and compare it directly with measurements of complete functional connectivity between cone photoreceptors and the four major types of ganglion cells in the primate retina, obtained at single-cell resolution. We find that the ganglion cell population exhibited 80\% efficiency in transmitting spatial information relative to the model. Both the retina and the model exhibited high redundancy (∼30\%) among ganglion cells of the same cell type. A novel and unique prediction of efficient coding, the relationships between projection patterns of individual cones to all ganglion cells, was consistent with the observed projection patterns in the retina. These results indicate a high level of efficiency with near-optimal redundancy in visual signaling by the retina.},

	Abstract = {Cortical circuits encode sensory stimuli through the firing of neuronal ensembles, and also produce spontaneous population patterns in the absence of sensory drive. This population activity is often characterized experimentally by the distribution of multineuron "words" (binary firing vectors), and a match between spontaneous and evoked word distributions has been suggested to reflect learning of a probabilistic model of the sensory world. We analyzed multineuron word distributions in sensory cortex of anesthetized rats and cats, and found that they are dominated by fluctuations in population firing rate rather than precise interactions between individual units. Furthermore, cortical word distributions change when brain state shifts, and similar behavior is seen in simulated networks with fixed, random connectivity. Our results suggest that similarity or dissimilarity in multineuron word distributions could primarily reflect similarity or dissimilarity in population firing rate dynamics, and not necessarily the precise interactions between neurons that would indicate learning of sensory features.},

@article{Klaes12,
	Abstract = {According to a prominent view of sensorimotor processing in primates, selection and specification of possible actions are not sequential operations. Rather, a decision for an action emerges from competition between different movement plans, which are specified and selected in parallel. For action choices which are based on ambiguous sensory input, the frontoparietal sensorimotor areas are considered part of the common underlying neural substrate for selection and specification of action. These areas have been shown capable of encoding alternative spatial motor goals in parallel during movement planning, and show signatures of competitive value-based selection among these goals. Since the same network is also involved in learning sensorimotor associations, competitive action selection (decision making) should not only be driven by the sensory evidence and expected reward in favor of either action, but also by the subject's learning history of different sensorimotor associations. Previous computational models of competitive neural decision making used predefined associations between sensory input and corresponding motor output. Such hard-wiring does not allow modeling of how decisions are influenced by sensorimotor learning or by changing reward contingencies. We present a dynamic neural field model which learns arbitrary sensorimotor associations with a reward-driven Hebbian learning algorithm. We show that the model accurately simulates the dynamics of action selection with different reward contingencies, as observed in monkey cortical recordings, and that it correctly predicted the pattern of choice errors in a control experiment. With our adaptive model we demonstrate how network plasticity, which is required for association learning and adaptation to new reward contingencies, can influence choice behavior. The field model provides an integrated and dynamic account for the operations of sensorimotor integration, working memory and action selection required for decision making in ambiguous choice situations. Decision making requires the selection between alternative actions. It has been suggested that action selection is not separate from motor preparation of the according actions, but rather that the selection emerges from the competition between different movement plans. We expand on this idea, and ask how action selection mechanisms interact with the learning of new action choices. We present a neurodynamic model that provides an integrated account of action selection and the learning of sensorimotor associations. The model explains recent electrophysiological findings from monkeys' sensorimotor cortex, and correctly predicted a newly described characteristic pattern of their choice errors. Based on the model, we present a theory of how geometrical sensorimotor mapping rules can be learned by association without the need for an explicit representation of the transformation rule, and how the learning history of these associations can have a direct influence on later decision making.},

@article{Grossberg06,
	Abstract = {What brain mechanisms underlie autism, and how do they give rise to autistic behavioral symptoms? This article describes a neural model, called the Imbalanced Spectrally Timed Adaptive Resonance Theory ({iSTART}) model, that proposes how cognitive, emotional, timing, and motor processes that involve brain regions such as the prefrontal and temporal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, and cerebellum may interact to create and perpetuate autistic symptoms. These model processes were originally developed to explain data concerning how the brain controls normal behaviors. The {iSTART} model shows how autistic behavioral symptoms may arise from prescribed breakdowns in these brain processes, notably a combination of underaroused emotional depression in the amygdala and related affective brain regions, learning of hyperspecific recognition categories in the temporal and prefrontal cortices, and breakdowns of adaptively timed attentional and motor circuits in the hippocampal system and cerebellum. The model clarifies how malfunctions in a subset of these mechanisms can, through a systemwide vicious circle of environmentally mediated feedback, cause and maintain problems with them all.},

@article{Daunizeau10,
	Abstract = {In a companion paper [1], we have presented a generic approach for inferring how subjects make optimal decisions under uncertainty. From a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective, uncertain representations correspond to "posterior" beliefs, which result from integrating (sensory) information with subjective "prior" beliefs. Preferences and goals are encoded through a "loss" (or "utility") function, which measures the cost incurred by making any admissible decision for any given (hidden or unknown) state of the world. By assuming that subjects make optimal decisions on the basis of updated (posterior) beliefs and utility (loss) functions, one can evaluate the likelihood of observed behaviour. In this paper, we describe a concrete implementation of this {meta-Bayesian} approach (i.e. a Bayesian treatment of Bayesian decision theoretic predictions) and demonstrate its utility by applying it to both simulated and empirical reaction time data from an associative learning task. Here, inter-trial variability in reaction times is modelled as reflecting the dynamics of the subjects' internal recognition process, i.e. the updating of representations (posterior densities) of hidden states over trials while subjects learn probabilistic audio-visual associations. We use this paradigm to demonstrate that our {meta-Bayesian} framework allows for (i) probabilistic inference on the dynamics of the subject's representation of environmental states, and for (ii) model selection to disambiguate between alternative preferences (loss functions) human subjects could employ when dealing with trade-offs, such as between speed and accuracy. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can be used to quantify subjective beliefs and preferences that underlie inter-individual differences in behaviour.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) was introduced to study the effective connectivity among brain regions using neuroimaging data. Until recently, {DCM} relied on deterministic models of distributed neuronal responses to external perturbation (e.g., sensory stimulation or task demands). However, accounting for stochastic fluctuations in neuronal activity and their interaction with task-specific processes may be of particular importance for studying state-dependent interactions. Furthermore, allowing for random neuronal fluctuations may render {DCM} more robust to model misspecification and finesse problems with network identification. In this article, we examine stochastic dynamic causal models ({sDCM}) in relation to their deterministic counterparts ({dDCM}) and highlight questions that can only be addressed with {sDCM}. We also compare the network identification performance of deterministic and stochastic {DCM}, using Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical case study of absence epilepsy. For example, our results demonstrate that stochastic {DCM} can exploit the modelling of neural noise to discriminate between direct and mediated connections. We conclude with a discussion of the added value and limitations of {sDCM}, in relation to its deterministic homologue.

	Abstract = {How interactions between neurons relate to tuned neural responses is a longstanding question in systems neuroscience. Here we use statistical modeling and simultaneous multi-electrode recordings to explore the relationship between these interactions and tuning curves in six different brain areas. We find that, in most cases, functional interactions between neurons provide an explanation of spiking that complements and, in some cases, surpasses the influence of canonical tuning curves. Modeling functional interactions improves both encoding and decoding accuracy by accounting for noise correlations and features of the external world that tuning curves fail to capture. In cortex, modeling coupling alone allows spikes to be predicted more accurately than tuning curve models based on external variables. These results suggest that statistical models of functional interactions between even relatively small numbers of neurons may provide a useful framework for examining neural coding.},

Discrete dynamics that emerge in brain networks are believed to be the neuronal correlate of category formation. Observations of such dynamics have recently been made; however, it is still unresolved if they actually match perceptual categories. Using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in the auditory cortex of mice, we show that local network activity evoked by sounds is constrained to few response modes. Transitions between response modes are characterized by an abrupt switch, indicating attractor-like, discrete dynamics. Moreover, we show that local cortical responses quantitatively predict discrimination performance and spontaneous categorization of sounds in behaving mice. Our results therefore demonstrate that local nonlinear dynamics in the auditory cortex generate spontaneous sound categories which can be selected for behavioral or perceptual decisions.

@article{Reichl12b,
	Abstract = {In the juvenile brain, the synaptic architecture of the visual cortex remains in a state of flux for months after the natural onset of vision and the initial emergence of feature selectivity in visual cortical neurons. It is an attractive hypothesis that visual cortical architecture is shaped during this extended period of juvenile plasticity by the coordinated optimization of multiple visual cortical maps such as orientation preference ({OP}), ocular dominance ({OD}), spatial frequency, or direction preference. In part (I) of this study we introduced a class of analytically tractable coordinated optimization models and solved representative examples, in which a spatially complex organization of the {OP} map is induced by interactions between the maps. We found that these solutions near symmetry breaking threshold predict a highly ordered map layout. Here we examine the time course of the convergence towards attractor states and optima of these models. In particular, we determine the timescales on which map optimization takes place and how these timescales can be compared to those of visual cortical development and plasticity. We also assess whether our models exhibit biologically more realistic, spatially irregular solutions at a finite distance from threshold, when the spatial periodicities of the two maps are detuned and when considering more than 2 feature dimensions. We show that, although maps typically undergo substantial rearrangement, no other solutions than pinwheel crystals and stripes dominate in the emerging layouts. Pinwheel crystallization takes place on a rather short timescale and can also occur for detuned wavelengths of different maps. Our numerical results thus support the view that neither minimal energy states nor intermediate transient states of our coordinated optimization models successfully explain the architecture of the visual cortex. We discuss several alternative scenarios that may improve the agreement between model solutions and biological observations. Neurons in the visual cortex of carnivores, primates and their close relatives form spatial representations or maps of multiple stimulus features. In part (I) of this study we theoretically predicted maps that are optima of a variety of optimization principles. When analyzing the joint optimization of two interacting maps we showed that for different optimization principles the resulting optima show a stereotyped, spatially perfectly periodic layout. Experimental maps, however, are much more irregular. In particular, in case of orientation columns it was found that different species show apparently species invariant statistics of point defects, so-called pinwheels. In this paper, we numerically investigate whether the spatial features of the stereotyped optima described in part (I) are expressed on biologically relevant timescales and whether other, spatially irregular, long-living states emerge that better reproduce the experimentally observed statistical properties of orientation maps. Moreover, we explore whether the coordinated optimization of more than two maps can lead to spatially irregular optima.},

@article{Reichl12a,
	Abstract = {In the primary visual cortex of primates and carnivores, functional architecture can be characterized by maps of various stimulus features such as orientation preference ({OP}), ocular dominance ({OD}), and spatial frequency. It is a long-standing question in theoretical neuroscience whether the observed maps should be interpreted as optima of a specific energy functional that summarizes the design principles of cortical functional architecture. A rigorous evaluation of this optimization hypothesis is particularly demanded by recent evidence that the functional architecture of orientation columns precisely follows species invariant quantitative laws. Because it would be desirable to infer the form of such an optimization principle from the biological data, the optimization approach to explain cortical functional architecture raises the following questions: i) What are the genuine ground states of candidate energy functionals and how can they be calculated with precision and rigor? ii) How do differences in candidate optimization principles impact on the predicted map structure and conversely what can be learned about a hypothetical underlying optimization principle from observations on map structure? iii) Is there a way to analyze the coordinated organization of cortical maps predicted by optimization principles in general? To answer these questions we developed a general dynamical systems approach to the combined optimization of visual cortical maps of {OP} and another scalar feature such as {OD} or spatial frequency preference. From basic symmetry assumptions we obtain a comprehensive phenomenological classification of possible inter-map coupling energies and examine representative examples. We show that each individual coupling energy leads to a different class of {OP} solutions with different correlations among the maps such that inferences about the optimization principle from map layout appear viable. We systematically assess whether quantitative laws resembling experimental observations can result from the coordinated optimization of orientation columns with other feature maps. Neurons in the visual cortex form spatial representations or maps of several stimulus features. How are different spatial representations of visual information coordinated in the brain? In this paper, we study the hypothesis that the coordinated organization of several visual cortical maps can be explained by joint optimization. Previous attempts to explain the spatial layout of functional maps in the visual cortex proposed specific optimization principles ad hoc. Here, we systematically analyze how optimization principles in a general class of models impact on the spatial layout of visual cortical maps. For each considered optimization principle we identify the corresponding optima and analyze their spatial layout. This directly demonstrates that by studying map layout and geometric inter-map correlations one can substantially constrain the underlying optimization principle. In particular, we study whether such optimization principles can lead to spatially complex patterns and to geometric correlations among cortical maps as observed in imaging experiments.},

@article{Brown11,
	Abstract = {Perception is the foundation of cognition and is fundamental to our beliefs and consequent action planning. The Editorial (this issue) asks: "what mechanisms, if any, mediate between perceptual and cognitive processes?" It has recently been argued that attention might furnish such a mechanism. In this paper, we pursue the idea that action planning (motor preparation) is an attentional phenomenon directed toward kinesthetic signals. This rests on a view of motor control as active inference, where predictions of proprioceptive signals are fulfilled by peripheral motor reflexes. If valid, active inference suggests that attention should not be limited to the optimal biasing of perceptual signals in the exteroceptive (e.g., visual) domain but should also bias proprioceptive signals during movement. Here, we investigate this idea using a classical attention (Posner) paradigm cast in a motor setting. Specially, we looked for decreases in reaction times when movements were preceded by valid relative to invalid cues. Furthermore, we addressed the hierarchical level at which putative attentional effects were expressed by independently cueing the nature of the movement and the hand used to execute it. We found a significant interaction between the validity of movement and effector cues on reaction times. This suggests that attentional bias might be mediated at a low level in the motor hierarchy, in an intrinsic frame of reference. This finding is consistent with attentional enabling of top-down predictions of proprioceptive input and may rely upon the same synaptic mechanisms that mediate directed spatial attention in the visual system.},

@article{Friston12f,
	Abstract = {Why are you reading this abstract? In some sense, your answer will cast the exercise as valuable-but what is value? In what follows, we suggest that value is evidence or, more exactly, log Bayesian evidence. This implies that a sufficient explanation for valuable behavior is the accumulation of evidence for internal models of our world. This contrasts with normative models of optimal control and reinforcement learning, which assume the existence of a value function that explains behavior, where (somewhat tautologically) behavior maximizes value. In this paper, we consider an alternative formulation-active inference-that replaces policies in normative models with prior beliefs about the (future) states agents should occupy. This enables optimal behavior to be cast purely in terms of inference: where agents sample their sensorium to maximize the evidence for their generative model of hidden states in the world, and minimize their uncertainty about those states. Crucially, this formulation resolves the tautology inherent in normative models and allows one to consider how prior beliefs are themselves optimized in a hierarchical setting. We illustrate these points by showing that any optimal policy can be specified with prior beliefs in the context of Bayesian inference. We then show how these prior beliefs are themselves prescribed by an imperative to minimize uncertainty. This formulation explains the saccadic eye movements required to read this text and defines the value of the visual sensations you are soliciting.},

The {VMD}'s concentration parameter and some fitness parameter that will be later defined, have been analyzed in the experimental part for determining their suitability as a image quality assessment measure in some particular distortions such as Gaussian blur or additive Gaussian noise. To achieve such measure, the local R\'{e}nyi entropy is calculated in four equally spaced orientations and used to determine the parameters of the von Mises distribution of the image entropy. Considering contextual images, experimental results after applying this model show that the best-in-focus noise-free images are associated with the highest values for the von Mises distribution concentration parameter and the highest approximation of image data to the von Mises distribution model. Our defined von Misses fitness parameter experimentally appears also as a suitable no-reference image quality assessment indicator for no-contextual images.},

	Abstract = {Information from the vestibular, sensorimotor, or visual systems can affect the firing of grid cells recorded in entorhinal cortex of rats. Optic flow provides information about the rat's linear and rotational velocity and, thus, could influence the firing pattern of grid cells. To investigate this possible link, we model parts of the rat's visual system and analyze their capability in estimating linear and rotational velocity. In our model a rat is simulated to move along trajectories recorded from rat's foraging on a circular ground platform. Thus, we preserve the intrinsic statistics of real rats' movements. Visual image motion is analytically computed for a spherical camera model and superimposed with noise in order to model the optic flow that would be available to the rat. This optic flow is fed into a template model to estimate the rat's linear and rotational velocities, which in turn are fed into an oscillatory interference model of grid cell firing. Grid scores are reported while altering the flow noise, tilt angle of the optical axis with respect to the ground, the number of flow templates, and the frequency used in the oscillatory interference model. Activity patterns are compatible with those of grid cells, suggesting that optic flow can contribute to their firing.},

@article{Baker12,
	Abstract = {The transmission of weak signals through the visual system is limited by internal noise. Its level can be estimated by adding external noise, which increases the variance within the detecting mechanism, causing masking. But experiments with white noise fail to meet three predictions: (a) noise has too small an influence on the slope of the psychometric function, (b) masking occurs even when the noise sample is identical in each two-alternative forced-choice ({2AFC}) interval, and (c) double-pass consistency is too low. We show that much of the energy of {2D} white noise masks extends well beyond the pass-band of plausible detecting mechanisms and that this suppresses signal activity. These problems are avoided by restricting the external noise energy to the target mechanisms by introducing a pedestal with a mean contrast of 0\% and independent contrast jitter in each {2AFC} interval (termed zero-dimensional [{0D}] noise). We compared the jitter condition to masking from {2D} white noise in double-pass masking and (novel) contrast matching experiments. Zero-dimensional noise produced the strongest masking, greatest double-pass consistency, and no suppression of perceived contrast, consistent with a noisy ideal observer. Deviations from this behavior for {2D} white noise were explained by cross-channel suppression with no need to appeal to induced internal noise or uncertainty. We conclude that (a) results from previous experiments using white pixel noise should be re-evaluated and (b) {0D} noise provides a cleaner method for investigating internal variability than pixel noise. Ironically then, the best external noise stimulus does not look noisy.},

	Abstract = {An observer traversing an environment actively relocates gaze to fixate objects. Evidence suggests that gaze is frequently directed toward the center of an object considered as target but more likely toward the edges of an object that appears as an obstacle. We suggest that this difference in gaze might be motivated by specific patterns of optic flow that are generated by either fixating the center or edge of an object. To support our suggestion we derive an analytical model that shows: Tangentially fixating the outer surface of an obstacle leads to strong flow discontinuities that can be used for flow-based segmentation. Fixation of the target center while gaze and heading are locked without head-, body-, or eye-rotations gives rise to a symmetric expansion flow with its center at the point being approached, which facilitates steering toward a target. We conclude that gaze control incorporates ecological constraints to improve the robustness of steering and collision avoidance by actively generating flows appropriate to solve the task.},

	Abstract = {Local field potentials ({LFPs}) are widely used to study the function of local networks in the brain. They are also closely correlated with the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal, the predominant contrast mechanism in functional magnetic resonance imaging. We developed a new laminar cortex model ({LCM}) to simulate the amplitude and frequency of {LFPs}. Our model combines the laminar architecture of the cerebral cortex and multiple continuum models to simulate the collective activity of cortical neurons. The five cortical layers (layer I, {II}/{III}, {IV}, V, and {VI}) are simulated as separate continuum models between which there are synaptic connections. The {LCM} was used to simulate the dynamics of the visual cortex under different conditions of visual stimulation. {LFPs} are reported for two kinds of visual stimulation: general visual stimulation and intermittent light stimulation. The power spectra of {LFPs} were calculated and compared with existing empirical data. The {LCM} was able to produce spontaneous {LFPs} exhibiting frequency-inverse (1/ƒ) power spectrum behaviour. Laminar profiles of current source density showed similarities to experimental data. General stimulation enhanced the oscillation of {LFPs} corresponding to gamma frequencies. During simulated intermittent light stimulation, the {LCM} captured the fundamental as well as high order harmonics as previously reported. The power spectrum expected with a reduction in layer {IV} neurons, often observed with focal cortical dysplasias associated with epilepsy was also simulated.},

	Abstract = {Physiological experiments indicate that the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) of primates plays a prominent role in the cortical analysis of visual motion. We investigated the role of {MT} in visual perception by examining the effect of chemical lesions of {MT} on psychophysical thresholds. We trained rhesus monkeys on psychophysical tasks that enabled us to assess their sensitivity to motion and to contrast. For motion psychophysics, we employed a dynamic random dot display that permitted us to vary the intensity of a motion signal in the midst of masking motion noise. We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into {MT} caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds. The results indicate that neural activity in {MT} contributes selectively to the perception of motion.},

@article{Maunsell83,
	Abstract = {1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The data were taken from 168 units that were histologically identified as being in {MT}. 2. The results confirm previous reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in {MT}. The response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed. The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most units in {MT} showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5. A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking similarity in response properties in {MT} of the two species. 6. The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in {MT} of the macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized.},

@article{Adams12,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces a model of oculomotor control during the smooth pursuit of occluded visual targets. This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle -- the minimisation of variational free energy -- to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements -- prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.},

@article{Meytlis12,
	Abstract = {The role of correlated firing in representing information has been a subject of much discussion. Several studies in retina, visual cortex, somatosensory cortex, and motor cortex, have suggested that it plays only a minor role, carrying <10\% of the total information carried by the neurons (, , , and ). A limiting factor of these studies, however, is that they were carried out using pairs of neurons; how the results extend to large populations was not clear. Recently, new methods for modeling network firing patterns have been developed (Nirenberg \& Pandarinath, 2012; Pillow et al., 2008), opening the door to answering this question for more complete populations. One study, Pillow et al. (2008), showed that including correlations increased information by a modest amount, ∼20\%; however, this work used only a single retina (primate) and a white noise stimulus. Here we performed the analysis using several retinas (mouse) and both white noise and natural scene stimuli. The results showed that correlations added little information when white noise stimuli were used (∼13\%), similar to Pillow et al.'s findings, and essentially no information when natural scene stimuli were used. Further, the results showed that ignoring correlations did not change the quality of the information carried by the population (as measured by comparing the full pattern of decoding errors). These results suggest generalization: the pairwise analysis in several species show that correlations account for very little of the total information. Now, the analysis with large populations in two species show a similar result, that correlations still account for only a small fraction of the total information, and, most significantly, the amount is not statistically significant when natural stimuli are used, making rapid advances in the study of population coding possible. \^{a}º We examine the role of correlations for carrying information in large populations. \^{a}º We find that correlations add little information under white noise stimulation. \^{a}º We find that correlations add no discernible information under natural scenes. \^{a}º This means neurons may be treated as independent for many applications.},

	Abstract = {Recent advances in the neuromorphic operation of atomic switches as individual synapse-like devices demonstrate the ability to process information with both short-term and long-term memorization in a single two terminal junction. Here it is shown that atomic switches can be self-assembled within a highly interconnected network of silver nanowires similar in structure to Turing's '' {B-Type} unorganized machine'', originally proposed as a randomly connected network of {NAND} logic gates. In these experimental embodiments, complex networks of coupled atomic switches exhibit emergent criticality similar in nature to previously reported electrical activity of biological brains and neuron assemblies. Rapid fluctuations in electrical conductance display metastability and power law scaling of temporal correlation lengths that are attributed to dynamic reorganization of the interconnected electro-ionic network resulting from induced non-equilibrium thermodynamic instabilities. These collective properties indicate a potential utility for real-time, multi-input processing of distributed sensory data through reservoir computation. We propose these highly coupled, nonlinear electronic networks as an implementable hardware-based platform toward the creation of physically intelligent machines.},

@article{Litwin-Kumar12,
	Abstract = {Throughout the central nervous system, the timescale over which pairs of neural spike trains are correlated is shaped by stimulus structure and behavioral context. Such shaping is thought to underlie important changes in the neural code, but the neural circuitry responsible is largely unknown. In this study, we investigate a stimulus-induced shaping of pairwise spike train correlations in the electrosensory system of weakly electric fish. Simultaneous single unit recordings of principal electrosensory cells show that an increase in the spatial extent of stimuli increases correlations at short (≈ 10 ms) timescales while simultaneously reducing correlations at long (≈ 100 ms) timescales. A spiking network model of the first two stages of electrosensory processing replicates this correlation shaping, under the assumptions that spatially broad stimuli both saturate feedforward afferent input and recruit an open-loop inhibitory feedback pathway. Our model predictions are experimentally verified using both the natural heterogeneity of the electrosensory system and pharmacological blockade of descending feedback projections. For weak stimuli, linear response analysis of the spiking network shows that the reduction of long timescale correlation for spatially broad stimuli is similar to correlation cancellation mechanisms previously suggested to be operative in mammalian cortex. The mechanism for correlation shaping supports population-level filtering of irrelevant distractor stimuli, thereby enhancing the population response to relevant prey and conspecific communication inputs.},

	Abstract = {
                Perceptual experience is influenced both by incoming sensory information and prior knowledge about the world, a concept recently formalised within Bayesian decision theory. We propose that Bayesian models can be applied to autism - a neurodevelopmental condition with atypicalities in sensation and perception - to pinpoint fundamental differences in perceptual mechanisms. We suggest specifically that attenuated Bayesian priors - 'hypo-priors' - may be responsible for the unique perceptual experience of autistic people, leading to a tendency to perceive the world more accurately rather than modulated by prior experience. In this account, we consider how hypo-priors might explain key features of autism - the broad range of sensory and other non-social atypicalities--in addition to the phenomenological differences in autistic perception.

@article{Boustani12,
	Abstract = {The mammalian cerebral cortex is characterized in vivo by irregular spontaneous activity, but how this ongoing dynamics affects signal processing and learning remains unknown. The associative plasticity rules demonstrated in vitro, mostly in silent networks, are based on the detection of correlations between presynaptic and postsynaptic activity and hence are sensitive to spontaneous activity and spurious correlations. Therefore, they cannot operate in realistic network states. Here, we present a new class of spike-timing-dependent plasticity learning rules with local floating plasticity thresholds, the slow dynamics of which account for metaplasticity. This novel algorithm is shown to both correctly predict homeostasis in synaptic weights and solve the problem of asymptotic stable learning in noisy states. It is shown to naturally encompass many other known types of learning rule, unifying them into a single coherent framework. The mixed presynaptic and postsynaptic dependency of the floating plasticity threshold is justified by a cascade of known molecular pathways, which leads to experimentally testable predictions.},

The set of responses obtained across trials can also be interpreted as the response of an ensemble of similar neurons receiving the same input, with the precise spike times representing synchronous volleys that would be effective in driving postsynaptic neurons. To study the reproducibility of the output spike times for different conditions that might occur in vivo, we somatically injected aperiodic current waveforms into cortical neurons in vitro and systematically varied the amplitude and {DC} offset of the fluctuations. As the amplitude of the fluctuations was increased, reliability increased and the spike times remained stable over a wide range of values. However, at specific values called bifurcation points, large shifts in the spike times were obtained in response to small changes in the stimulus, resulting in multiple spike patterns that were revealed using an unsupervised classification method. Increasing the {DC} offset, which mimicked an overall increase in network background activity, also revealed bifurcation points and increased the reliability. Furthermore, the spike times shifted earlier with increasing offset. Although the reliability was reduced at bifurcation points, a theoretical analysis showed that the information about the stimulus time course was increased because each of the spike time patterns contained different information about the input. Neurons respond with precise spike times to fluctuating current injections, leading to peaks in ensemble firing rate. The structure of these peaks, or spike events, provides a compact description of the neural response. We explore the consequences of precise spike times for neural coding in vivo, by investigating the spike event structure of virtual cell assemblies constructed in vitro. We incorporate diversity of electrophysiological response properties by varying the amplitude and offset of a common stimulus waveform injected in vitro. Across multiple trials, spike trains produce precise events in response to upswings in the stimulus, suggesting that such upswings in in vivo assemblies may effectively drive postsynaptic targets and transmit information about the stimulus. In simulations and in vitro, we identified bifurcations in the event structure as the amplitude or the offset was varied. Near bifurcation points, the neural response showed heightened sensitivity to intrinsic neural noise, leading to multiple competing response patterns, and enriching the representation of stimulus features by the ensemble output. The presence of bifurcations could therefore allow an ideal observer to extract more information about the stimulus. Our results suggest that event structure bifurcations may provide a mechanism for boosting information transmission in vivo.},

@article{Marre09,
	Abstract = {Irregular ongoing activity in cortical networks is often modeled as arising from recurrent connectivity. Yet it remains unclear to what extent its presence corrupts sensory signal transmission and network computational capabilities. In a recurrent cortical-like network, we have determined the activity patterns that are better transmitted and self-sustained by the network. We show that reproducible spiking and subthreshold dynamics can be triggered if the statistics of the imposed external drive are consistent with patterns previously seen in the ongoing activity. A subset of neurons in the network, constrained to replay temporal pattern segments extracted from the recorded ongoing activity of the same network, reliably drives the remaining, free-running neurons to call the rest of the pattern. Comparison with surrogate Poisson patterns indicates that the efficiency of the recall and completion process depends on the similarity between the statistical properties of the input with previous ongoing activity The reliability of evoked dynamics in recurrent networks is thus dependent on the stimulus used, and we propose that the similarity between spontaneous and evoked activity in sensory cortical areas could be a signature of efficient transmission and propagation across cortical networks.},

	Abstract = {To what extent cortical pathways show significant weight differences and whether these differences are consistent across animals (thereby comprising robust connectivity profiles) is an important and unresolved neuroanatomical issue. Here we report a quantitative retrograde tracer analysis in the cynomolgus macaque monkey of the weight consistency of the afferents of cortical areas across brains via calculation of a weight index (fraction of labeled neurons, {FLN}). Injection in 8 cortical areas (3 occipital plus 5 in the other lobes) revealed a consistent pattern: small subcortical input (1.3\% cumulative {FLN}), high local intrinsic connectivity (80\% {FLN}), high-input form neighboring areas (15\% cumulative {FLN}), and weak long-range corticocortical connectivity (3\% cumulative {FLN}). Corticocortical {FLN} values of projections to areas V1, V2, and V4 showed heavy-tailed, lognormal distributions spanning 5 orders of magnitude that were consistent, demonstrating significant connectivity profiles. These results indicate that 1) connection weight heterogeneity plays an important role in determining cortical network specificity, 2) high investment in local projections highlights the importance of local processing, and 3) transmission of information across multiple hierarchy levels mainly involves pathways having low {FLN} values.},

@article{Schneidman06,
	Abstract = {Biological networks have so many possible states that exhaustive sampling is impossible. Successful analysis thus depends on simplifying hypotheses, but experiments on many systems hint that complicated, higher-order interactions among large groups of elements have an important role. Here we show, in the vertebrate retina, that weak correlations between pairs of neurons coexist with strongly collective behaviour in the responses of ten or more neurons. We find that this collective behaviour is described quantitatively by models that capture the observed pairwise correlations but assume no higher-order interactions. These maximum entropy models are equivalent to Ising models, and predict that larger networks are completely dominated by correlation effects. This suggests that the neural code has associative or error-correcting properties, and we provide preliminary evidence for such behaviour. As a first test for the generality of these ideas, we show that similar results are obtained from networks of cultured cortical neurons.},

@article{Bennett03,
	Abstract = {During the course of pursuing a moving target there are often periods of transient disappearance as it moves behind objects and surfaces. In experimental settings, eye velocity decays rapidly on the extinction of a moving target. However, eye velocity does not decay to zero if there is an expectation the target will reappear further along its trajectory. Increasing eye velocity to coincide with target reappearance could minimize the developing velocity error, but it remains to be empirically verified whether this can be achieved. The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of stimulus predictability, target velocity, and interstimulus interval ({ISI}) on ocular pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target. We confirmed that subjects (n = 9) did not maintain eye velocity close to target velocity for the duration of the {ISI}. In general, after an initial reduction in eye velocity the majority of subjects (n = 7) exhibited a significant increase before target reappearance. The timing of the velocity increase was not influenced by target velocity, stimulus predictability, or {ISI}. Consequently, for the 900-ms {ISI} the increase occurred too early and the eye was decelerating at the moment of target reappearance. These results are consistent with a reduction in gain being applied to the visuomotor drive when the target disappeared, followed by a reactivation in expectation of target reappearance. We modeled this process such that gain was modulated within a reafferent feedback system, hence preserving its output in the absence of negative visual feedback and enabling an anticipatory increase in eye velocity before expected target reappearance.},

@article{Goldreich92,
	Abstract = {1. Our goal was to discriminate between two classes of models for pursuit eye movements. The monkey's pursuit system and both classes of model exhibit oscillations around target velocity during tracking of ramp target motion. However, the mechanisms that determine the frequency of oscillations differ in the two classes of model. In "internal feedback" models, oscillations are controlled by internal feedback loops, and the frequency of oscillation does not depend strongly on the delay in visual feedback. In "image motion" models, oscillations are controlled by visual feedback, and the frequency of oscillation does depend on the delay in visual feedback. 2. We measured the frequency of oscillation during pursuit of ramp target motion as a function of the total delay for visual feedback. For the shortest feedback delays of approximately 70 ms, the frequency of oscillation was between 6 and 7 Hz. Increases in feedback delay caused decreases in the frequency of oscillation. The effect of increasing feedback delay was similar, whether the increases were produced naturally by dimming and decreasing the size of the tracking target or artificially with the computer. We conclude that the oscillations in eye velocity during pursuit of ramp target motion are controlled by visual inputs, as suggested by the image motion class of models. 3. Previous experiments had suggested that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are unable to respond well to frequencies as high as the 6-7 Hz at which eye velocity oscillates in monkeys. We therefore tested the response to target vibration at an amplitude of +/- 8 degrees/s and frequencies as high as 15 Hz. For target vibration at 6 Hz, the gain of pursuit, defined as the amplitude of eye velocity divided by the amplitude of target velocity, was as high as 0.65. We conclude that the visuomotor pathways for pursuit are capable of processing image motion at high temporal frequencies. 4. The gain of pursuit was much larger when the target vibrated around a constant speed of 15 degrees/s than when it vibrated around a stationary position. This suggests that the pursuit pathways contain a switch that must be closed to allow the visuomotor pathways for pursuit to operate at their full gain. The switch apparently remains open for target vibration around a stationary position. 5. The responses to target vibration revealed a frequency at which eye velocity lagged target velocity by 180 degrees and at which one monkey showed a local peak in the gain of {pursuit.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Churchland03,
	Abstract = {We recorded the smooth-pursuit eye movements of monkeys in response to targets that were extinguished (blinked) for 200 ms in mid-trajectory. Eye velocity declined considerably during the target blinks, even when the blinks were completely predictable in time and space. Eye velocity declined whether blinks were presented during steady-state pursuit of a constant-velocity target, during initiation of pursuit before target velocity was reached, or during eye accelerations induced by a change in target velocity. When a physical occluder covered the trajectory of the target during blinks, creating the impression that the target moved behind it, the decline in eye velocity was reduced or abolished. If the target was occluded once the eye had reached target velocity, pursuit was only slightly poorer than normal, uninterrupted pursuit. In contrast, if the target was occluded during the initiation of pursuit, while the eye was accelerating toward target velocity, pursuit during occlusion was very different from normal pursuit. Eye velocity remained relatively stable during target occlusion, showing much less acceleration than normal pursuit and much less of a decline than was produced by a target blink. Anticipatory or predictive eye acceleration was typically observed just prior to the reappearance of the target. Computer simulations show that these results are best understood by assuming that a mechanism of eye-velocity memory remains engaged during target occlusion but is disengaged during target blinks.},

	Abstract = {Information processing in the nervous system during sensorimotor tasks with inherent uncertainty has been shown to be consistent with Bayesian integration. Bayes optimal decision-makers are, however, risk-neutral in the sense that they weigh all possibilities based on prior expectation and sensory evidence when they choose the action with highest expected value. In contrast, risk-sensitive decision-makers are sensitive to model uncertainty and bias their decision-making processes when they do inference over unobserved variables. In particular, they allow deviations from their probabilistic model in cases where this model makes imprecise predictions. Here we test for risk-sensitivity in a sensorimotor integration task where subjects exhibit Bayesian information integration when they infer the position of a target from noisy sensory feedback. When introducing a cost associated with subjects' response, we found that subjects exhibited a characteristic bias towards low cost responses when their uncertainty was high. This result is in accordance with risk-sensitive decision-making processes that allow for deviations from Bayes optimal decision-making in the face of uncertainty. Our results suggest that both Bayesian integration and risk-sensitivity are important factors to understand sensorimotor integration in a quantitative fashion. Statistically optimal decision-makers use probabilistic predictive models of their environment to achieve their goals. However, in real life such probabilistic models can be wrong or only approximately true, in which case basing decisions exclusively on the statistics of such models can constitute a problematic decision criterion. In contrast, risk-sensitive decision-makers can take model uncertainty into account. They allow deviations from their probabilistic model depending on the quality of the predictions of the model. In particular, they trust their model less if it makes imprecise predictions and bias their decisions towards worst-case or best-case outcomes. Here we designed a sensorimotor task where subjects exhibit Bayesian information integration when they infer the hidden location of a target and they had to decide to make a more or less costly movement. We found that subjects exhibited a bias with respect to the statistically optimal movement towards less costly outcomes, the higher the uncertainty about the target location was. This interplay between estimation uncertainty and movement cost is consistent with a risk-sensitive decision criterion that takes model uncertainty into account.},

We propose a population coding model of spiking neurons with a policy gradient procedure that successfully acquires optimal strategies for classical game-theoretical tasks. The suggested population reinforcement learning reproduces data from human behavioral experiments for the blackjack and the inspector game. It performs optimally according to a pure (deterministic) and mixed (stochastic) Nash equilibrium, respectively. In contrast, {temporal-difference(TD})-learning, covariance-learning, and basic reinforcement learning fail to perform optimally for the stochastic strategy. Spike-based population reinforcement learning, shown to follow the stochastic reward gradient, is therefore a viable candidate to explain automated decision learning of a Nash equilibrium in two-player games. Socio-economic interactions are captured in a game theoretic framework by multiple agents acting on a pool of goods to maximize their own reward. Neuroeconomics tries to explain the agent's behavior in neuronal terms. Classical models in neuroeconomics use {temporal-difference(TD})-learning. This algorithm incrementally updates values of state-action pairs, and actions are selected according to a value-based policy. In contrast, policy gradient methods do not introduce values as intermediate steps, but directly derive an action selection policy which maximizes the total expected reward. We consider a decision making network consisting of a population of neurons which, upon presentation of a spatio-temporal spike pattern, encodes binary actions by the population output spike trains and a subsequent majority vote. The action selection policy is parametrized by the strengths of synapses projecting to the population neurons. A gradient learning rule is derived which modifies these synaptic strengths and which depends on four factors, the pre- and postsynaptic activities, the action and the reward. We show that for classical game-theoretical tasks our decision making network endowed with the four-factor learning rule leads to Nash-optimal action selections. It also mimics human decision learning for these same tasks.},

@article{Hudson12,
	Abstract = {We analyze the problem of obstacle avoidance from a Bayesian decision-theoretic perspective using an experimental task in which reaches around a virtual obstacle were made toward targets on an upright monitor. Subjects received monetary rewards for touching the target and incurred losses for accidentally touching the intervening obstacle. The locations of target-obstacle pairs within the workspace were varied from trial to trial. We compared human performance to that of a Bayesian ideal movement planner (who chooses motor strategies maximizing expected gain) using the Dominance Test employed in Hudson et al. (2007). The ideal movement planner suffers from the same sources of noise as the human, but selects movement plans that maximize expected gain in the presence of that noise. We find good agreement between the predictions of the model and actual performance in most but not all experimental conditions. In everyday, cluttered environments, moving to reach or grasp an object can result in unintended collisions with other objects along the path of movement. Depending on what we run into (a priceless Ming vase, a crotchety colleague) we can suffer serious monetary or social consequences. It makes sense to choose movement trajectories that trade off the value of reaching a goal against the consequences of unintended collisions along the way. In the research described here, subjects made speeded movements to touch targets while avoiding obstacles placed along the natural reach trajectory. There were explicit monetary rewards for hitting the target and explicit monetary costs for accidentally hitting the intervening obstacle. We varied the cost and location of the obstacle across conditions. The task was to earn as large a monetary bonus as possible, which required that reaches curve around obstacles only to the extent justified by the location and cost of the obstacle. We compared human performance in this task to that of a Bayesian movement planner who maximized expected gain on each trial. In most conditions, but not all, movement strategies were close to optimal.},

@article{Bogadhi13,
	Abstract = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, {1D} motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, {2D} motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \& Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori ({MAP}) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either "pure" {1D} or "pure" {2D} motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

	Abstract = {Monkeys and humans are able to perform different types of slow eye movements. The analysis of the eye movement parameters, as well as the investigation of the neuronal activity underlying the execution of slow eye movements, offer an excellent opportunity to study higher brain functions such as motion processing, sensorimotor integration, and predictive mechanisms as well as neuronal plasticity and motor learning. As an example, since there exists a tight connection between the execution of slow eye movements and the processing of any kind of motion, these eye movements can be used as a biological, behavioural probe for the neuronal processing of motion. Global visual motion elicits optokinetic nystagmus, acting as a visual gaze stabilization system. The underlying neuronal substrate consists mainly of the cortico-pretecto-olivo-cerebellar pathway. Additionally, another gaze stabilization system depends on the vestibular input known as the vestibule-ocular reflex. The interactions between the visual and vestibular stabilization system are essential to fulfil the plasticity of the vestibule-ocular reflex representing a simple form of learning. Local visual motion is a necessary prerequisite for the execution of smooth pursuit eye movements which depend on the cortico-pontino-cerebellar pathway. In the wake of saccades, short-latency eye movements can be elicited by brief movements of the visual scene. Finally, eye movements directed to objects in different planes of depth consist of slow movements also. Although there is some overlap in the neuronal substrates underlying these different types of slow eye movements, there are brain areas whose activity can be associated exclusively with the execution of a special type of slow eye movement.

@article{Churchland01,
	Abstract = {We recorded behavioral, perceptual, and neural responses to targets that provided apparent visual motion consisting of a sequence of stationary flashes. Increasing the flash separation degrades the quality of motion, but for some separations evoked larger smooth pursuit responses from both humans and monkeys than did smooth motion. The same flash separations also produced an increase in perceived speed in humans. Recordings from single neurons in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}) of awake monkeys revealed a potential basis for the illusion in the population response. Apparent motion produced diminished neural responses relative to smooth motion. However, neurons with slow preferred speeds were more affected than were those with fast preferred speeds. Increasing the flash separation thus caused the population response to become diminished in amplitude and to shift so that the most active neurons had higher preferred speeds. The entire constellation of effects of apparent motion on the magnitude and latency of the initial pursuit response was accounted for if the {MT} population response was decoded by (1) creating an opponent motion signal for each neuron by treating its preferred and opposite direction responses as those of a pair of oppositely tuned neurons and (2) computing the vector average of these opponent motion signals. Other ways of decoding the population response recorded in {MT} failed to account for one or more aspects of behavior. We conclude that the effects of apparent motion on both pursuit and perception can be accounted for if target speed is estimated from the {MT} population response by a neural computation that implements a vector average based on opponent motion.},

	Abstract = {A sensory stimulus evokes activity in many neurons, creating a population response that must be '' decoded'' by the brain to estimate the parameters of that stimulus. Most decoding models have suggested complex neural circuits that compute optimal estimates of sensory parameters on the basis of responses in many sensory neurons. We propose a slightly suboptimal but practically simpler decoder. Decoding neurons integrate their inputs across 100 ms, incoming spikes are weighted by the preferred stimulus of the neuron of origin, and a local, cellular nonlinearity approximates divisive normalization without dividing explicitly. The suboptimal decoder includes two simplifying approximations. It uses estimates of firing rate across the population rather than computing the total population response, and it implements divisive normalization with local cellular mechanisms of single neurons rather than more complicated neural circuit mechanisms. When applied to the practical problem of estimating target speed from a realistic simulation of the population response in extrastriate visual area {MT}, the suboptimal decoder has almost the same accuracy and precision as traditional decoding models. It succeeds in predicting the precision and imprecision of motor behavior using a suboptimal decoding computation because it adds only a small amount of imprecision to the code for target speed in {MT}, which is itself imprecise.},

Findings concerning the segregation of motion and color information have been at the forefront of the evidence in favor of the parallel processing scheme. A number of studies have shown that motion perception is impaired for isoluminant stimuli, which are thought to isolate the color system. However, there are now many studies, the results of which are incompatible with the simple idea of segregated pathways. We propose two processing streams for motion that differ mostly in their temporal characteristics. Although neither of the two motion streams is color-blind, as was originally suggested, they differ radically in the way they process color information. The view that we propose provides a framework that reconciles a number of seemingly contradictory results. Evidence to support the new framework comes from psychophysical, physiological and lesion studies.},

@article{Naud12,
	Abstract = {The response of a neuron to a time-dependent stimulus, as measured in a {Peri-Stimulus}-{Time-Histogram} ({PSTH}), exhibits an intricate temporal structure that reflects potential temporal coding principles. Here we analyze the encoding and decoding of {PSTHs} for spiking neurons with arbitrary refractoriness and adaptation. As a modeling framework, we use the spike response model, also known as the generalized linear neuron model. Because of refractoriness, the effect of the most recent spike on the spiking probability a few milliseconds later is very strong. The influence of the last spike needs therefore to be described with high precision, while the rest of the neuronal spiking history merely introduces an average self-inhibition or adaptation that depends on the expected number of past spikes but not on the exact spike timings. Based on these insights, we derive a 'quasi-renewal equation' which is shown to yield an excellent description of the firing rate of adapting neurons. We explore the domain of validity of the quasi-renewal equation and compare it with other rate equations for populations of spiking neurons. The problem of decoding the stimulus from the population response (or {PSTH}) is addressed analogously. We find that for small levels of activity and weak adaptation, a simple accumulator of the past activity is sufficient to decode the original input, but when refractory effects become large decoding becomes a non-linear function of the past activity. The results presented here can be applied to the mean-field analysis of coupled neuron networks, but also to arbitrary point processes with negative self-interaction. How can information be encoded and decoded in populations of adapting neurons? A quantitative answer to this question requires a mathematical expression relating neuronal activity to the external stimulus, and, conversely, stimulus to neuronal activity. Although widely used equations and models exist for the special problem of relating external stimulus to the action potentials of a single neuron, the analogous problem of relating the external stimulus to the activity of a population has proven more difficult. There is a bothersome gap between the dynamics of single adapting neurons and the dynamics of populations. Moreover, if we ignore the single neurons and describe directly the population dynamics, we are faced with the ambiguity of the adapting neural code. The neural code of adapting populations is ambiguous because it is possible to observe a range of population activities in response to a given instantaneous input. Somehow the ambiguity is resolved by the knowledge of the population history, but how precisely? In this article we use approximation methods to provide mathematical expressions that describe the encoding and decoding of external stimuli in adapting populations. The theory presented here helps to bridge the gap between the dynamics of single neurons and that of populations.},

This principle is widely used in neuroscience as a normative model of decision and action, but current versions of this model fail to consider how decisions are actually converted into actions (i.e. the formation of trajectories). Here, we describe an approach where decision making and motor control are optimal, iterative processes derived from the maximization of the discounted, weighted difference between expected rewards and foreseeable motor efforts. The model accounts for decision making in cost/benefit situations, and detailed characteristics of control and goal tracking in realistic motor tasks. As a normative construction, the model is relevant to address the neural bases and pathological aspects of decision making and motor control.

	Abstract = {Our perceptions are fundamentally altered by our knowledge of the world. When cloud-gazing, for example, we tend spontaneously to recognize known objects in the random configurations of evaporated moisture. How our brains acquire such knowledge and how it impacts our perceptions is a matter of heated discussion. A topic of recent debate has concerned the hypothesis that our visual system 'assumes' that objects are static or move slowly [1] rather than more quickly [1] , [2] and [3] . This hypothesis, or 'prior on slow speeds', was postulated because it could elegantly explain a number of perceptual biases observed in situations of uncertainty [2]. Interestingly, those biases affect not only the perception of speed, but also the direction of motion. For example, the direction of a line whose endpoints are hidden (as in the 'aperture problem') or poorly visible (for example, at low contrast or for short presentations) is more often perceived as being perpendicular to the line than it really is --- an illusion consistent with expecting that the line moves more slowly than it really does. How this 'prior on slow speeds' is shaped by experience and whether it remains malleable in adults is unclear. Here, we show that systematic exposure to high-speed stimuli can lead to a reversal of this direction illusion. This suggests that the shaping of the brain's prior expectations of even the most basic properties of the environment is a continuous process.},

@article{Jancke04,
	Abstract = {Exploring visual illusions reveals fundamental principles of cortical processing. Illusory motion perception of non-moving stimuli was described almost a century ago by Gestalt psychologists. However, the underlying neuronal mechanisms remain unknown. To explore cortical mechanisms underlying the 'line-motion' illusion, we used real-time optical imaging, which is highly sensitive to subthreshold activity. We examined, in the visual cortex of the anaesthetized cat, responses to five stimuli: a stationary small square and a long bar; a moving square; a drawn-out bar; and the well-known line-motion illusion, a stationary square briefly preceding a long stationary bar presentation. Whereas flashing the bar alone evoked the expected localized, short latency and high amplitude activity patterns, presenting a square 60-100 ms before a bar induced the dynamic activity patterns resembling that of fast movement. The preceding square, even though physically non-moving, created gradually propagating subthreshold cortical activity that must contribute to illusory motion, because it was indistinguishable from cortical representations of real motion in this area. These findings demonstrate the effect of spatio-temporal patterns of subthreshold synaptic potentials on cortical processing and the shaping of perception.},

	Abstract = {1. Single units in the 3. and 6. nerve nuclei were recorded, together with the stimulus and eye movements in trained macaques during pursuit eye movements. 2. The relationship between the impulse rate of an oculomotor motoneuron and the corresponding eye movements can be described by a first order differential equation only, if distinctions are made between the modes of the oculomotor system (e.g., fixation or pursuit) and between the agonist phase and the antagonist phase of the corresponding eye muscle. 3. The trained monkeys showed a frequency response during pursuit eye movements, which was comparable to that of humans and which clearly indicates the existence of a predictor mechanism. 4. After sudden stimulus disappearance in the pursuit mode, both the neural impulse rate and the eye movement performed smooth changes for more than 1s. These slow post-pursuit eye movements were related to the time course before stimulus disappearance. 5. Our findings lead to the hypothesis, that pursuit eye movements in primates, if elicited by small moving visual stimuli, are generated by means of a feedback system consisting of a predictor mechanism, the parameters of which are continuously corrected by an updating process in the afferent visual system.},

@article{Becker85,
	Abstract = {Eye movements were recorded in human subjects who tracked a target spot which moved horizontally at constant speeds. At random times during its trajectory, the target disappeared for variable periods of time and the subjects attempted to continue tracking the invisible target. The smooth pursuit component of their eye movements was isolated and averaged. About 190 ms after the target disappeared, the smooth pursuit velocity began to decelerate rapidly. The time course of this deceleration was similar to that in response to a visible target whose velocity decreased suddenly. After a deceleration lasting about 280 ms, the velocity stabilized at a new, reduced level which we call the residual velocity. The residual velocity remained more or less constant or declined only slowly even when the target remained invisible for 4 s. When the same target velocity was used in all trials of an experiment, the subjects' residual velocity amounted to 60\% of their normal pursuit velocity. When the velocity was varied randomly from trial to trial, the residual velocity was smaller; for target velocities of 5, 10, and 20 deg/s it reached 55, 47, and 39\% respectively. The subjects needed to see targets of unforeseeable velocity for no more than 300 ms in order to develop a residual velocity that was characteristic of the given target velocity. When a target of unknown velocity disappeared at the very moment the subject expected it to start, a smooth movement developed nonetheless and reached within 300 ms a peak velocity of 5 deg/s which was independent of the actual target velocity and reflected a "default" value for the pursuit system. Thereafter the eyes decelerated briefly and then continued with a constant or slightly decreasing velocity of 2-4 deg/s until the target reappeared. Even when the subjects saw no moving target during an experiment, they could produce a smooth movement in the dark and could grade its velocity as a function of that of an imagined target. We suggest that the residual velocity reflects a first order prediction of target movement which is attenuated by a variable gain element. When subjects are pursuing a visible target, the gain of this element is close to unity. When the target disappears but continued tracking is attempted, the gain is reduced to a value between 0.4 and 0.6.},

@article{Pavel92,
	Abstract = {We investigated observers' ability to extrapolate a linear trajectory of a moving point, in order to determine how effectively the visual system can combine orientation and position information for moving stimuli. Observers saw a probe dot moving along a straight line toward a stationary target dot. The probe dot extinguished before reaching the target, and the observers' task was to judge whether an extrapolation of the trajectory of the probe would pass to the left or right of the target. Performance was measured as a function of probe velocity, length of the visible trajectory, and location of the target. The empirical results indicated that over a range of conditions, performance on this task is qualitatively similar to, but somewhat less accurate than, that on an analogous task with static stimuli. A four-component model is presented to account for the results. The model specifies an accurate extraction of probe motion parameters, extrapolation of the motion by an ideal observer, and limitations on the input to these processes in the form of visual field spatial inhomogeneity and temporal decay of position information.},

@article{Shi12,
	Abstract = {Neural transmission latency would introduce a spatial lag when an object moves across the visual field, if the latency was not compensated. A visual predictive mechanism has been proposed, which overcomes such spatial lag by extrapolating the position of the moving object forward. However, a forward position shift is often absent if the object abruptly stops moving (motion-termination). A recent '' correction-for-extrapolation'' hypothesis suggests that the absence of forward shifts is caused by sensory signals representing 'failed' predictions. Thus far, this hypothesis has been tested only for extra-foveal retinal locations. We tested this hypothesis using two foveal scotomas: scotoma to dim light and scotoma to blue light. We found that the perceived position of a dim dot is extrapolated into the fovea during motion-termination. Next, we compared the perceived position shifts of a blue versus a green moving dot. As predicted the extrapolation at motion-termination was only found with the blue moving dot. The results provide new evidence for the correction-for-extrapolation hypothesis for the region with highest spatial acuity, the fovea.},

@article{Sokolov97,
	Abstract = {A study of the effect of the size of a moving target and the extent of its visible motion on motion extrapolation is reported. Targets (a horizontal pair of dots separated by either 0.2 or 0.8 deg) moved across a 10 deg rectilinear path and were then occluded. Observers pressed a key when they thought the leading dot of a hidden target had reached a randomly specified position (0-12 deg from the point of occlusion). In experiment 1, in agreement with velocity-transposition predictions, at moderate (5 deg s-1) and rapid (10 deg s-1) velocities extrapolation times were longer for large targets than for small ones. At slow velocity (2.5 deg s-1) this effect was reversed. In experiment 2 the effect of target size at moderate velocity was found for a short (2.5 deg) visible path. However, the extrapolation time increased with shorter (2.5 deg versus 10 deg) paths. A proposed account of these effects suggests that the visual system performs a spatiotemporal scaling, according to the velocity-transposition principle, not only of visible motion but also of extrapolated motion.},

@article{Barnes91,
	Abstract = {1. Experiments have been conducted on human subjects to determine the role of prediction in smooth eye movement control. Subjects were required to actively pursue a small target or stare passively at a larger display as it moved in the horizontal plane. 2. Target motion was basically periodic, but, after a random number of cycles an unexpected change was made in the amplitude, direction or frequency of target motion. Initially, the periodic stimulus took the form of a square waveform. In subsequent experiments, a triangular or sawtooth waveform was used, but in order to examine the timing of the response in relation to stimulus appearance, the target was tachistoscopically illuminated for 40-320 ms at the time that it passed through the mid-line position. 3. When subjects either actively pursued the target or stared passively at the larger display a characteristic pattern of steady-state eye movement was evoked composed of two phases, an initial build-up of eye velocity that reached a peak after 200 ms, followed by a decay phase with a time constant of 0.5-2 s. The build-up phase was initiated prior to target displacement for square-wave motion and before onset of target illumination for other waveforms. 4. The peak eye velocity evoked gradually increased over the first two to four cycles of repeated stimulation. Simultaneously, the response became more phase advanced, the reaction time between stimulus onset and the time at which peak velocity occurred decreasing from an average of 300 to 200 ms for triangular waveform stimuli. 5. When there was a sudden and unexpected change in amplitude and direction of the stimulus waveform, the eye movement induced had a peak velocity and direction that was inappropriate for the current visual stimulus, but which was highly correlated with the features of the preceding sequence in the stimulus. 6. When there was a sudden change in the frequency of the stimulus waveform the predictive eye movement was induced with a timing appropriate to the periodicity of the previous sequence but inappropriate to the new sequence. 7. The results indicate that prediction is carried out through the storage of information about both the magnitude and timing of eye velocity. The trajectory of the averaged eye velocity response was similar in form irrespective of the duration of target exposure or basic stimulus frequency, suggesting that the predictive estimate is released as a stereotyped volley of constant duration but varying magnitude under the control of a periodicity {estimator.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Roach09,
	Abstract = {Prolonged exposure to consistent visual motion can significantly alter the perceived direction and speed of subsequently viewed objects. These perceptual aftereffects have provided invaluable tools with which to study the mechanisms of motion adaptation and draw inferences about the properties of underlying neural populations. Behavioral studies of the time course of motion aftereffects typically reveal a gradual process of adaptation spanning a period of multiple seconds. In contrast, neurophysiological studies have documented multiple motion adaptation effects operating over similar, or substantially faster (i.e., sub-second) time scales. Here we investigated motion adaptation by measuring time-dependent changes in the ability of moving stimuli to distort the perceived position of briefly presented static objects. The temporal dynamics of these motion-induced spatial distortions reveal the operation of two dissociable mechanisms of motion adaptation with differing properties. The first is rapid (subsecond), acts to limit the distortions induced by continuing motion, but is not sufficient to produce an aftereffect once the motion signal disappears. The second gradually accumulates over a period of seconds, does not modulate the size of distortions produced by continuing motion, and produces repulsive aftereffects after motion offset. These results provide new psychophysical evidence for the operation of multiple mechanisms of motion adaptation operating over distinct time scales.},

@article{Nijhawan08,
	Abstract = {A necessary consequence of the nature of neural transmission systems is that as change in the physical state of a time-varying event takes place, delays produce error between the instantaneous registered state and the external state. Another source of delay is the transmission of internal motor commands to muscles and the inertia of the musculoskeletal system. How does the central nervous system compensate for these pervasive delays? Although it has been argued that delay compensation occurs late in the motor planning stages, even the earliest visual processes, such as phototransduction, contribute significantly to delays. I argue that compensation is not an exclusive property of the motor system, but rather, is a pervasive feature of the central nervous system ({CNS}) organization. Although the motor planning system may contain a highly flexible compensation mechanism, accounting not just for delays but also variability in delays (e.g., those resulting from variations in luminance contrast, internal body temperature, muscle fatigue, etc.), visual mechanisms also contribute to compensation. Previous suggestions of this notion of \^{a}visual prediction\^{a} led to a lively debate producing re-examination of previous arguments, new analyses, and review of the experiments presented here. Understanding visual prediction will inform our theories of sensory processes and visual perception, and will impact our notion of visual awareness.},

	Abstract = {It is well-established that synapse formation involves highly selective chemospecific mechanisms, but how neuron arbors are positioned before synapse formation remains unclear. Using {3D} reconstructions of 298 neocortical cells of different types (including nest basket, small basket, large basket, bitufted, pyramidal, and Martinotti cells), we constructed a structural model of a cortical microcircuit, in which cells of different types were independently and randomly placed. We compared the positions of physical appositions resulting from the incidental overlap of axonal and dendritic arbors in the model (statistical structural connectivity) with the positions of putative functional synapses (functional synaptic connectivity) in 90 synaptic connections reconstructed from cortical slice preparations. Overall, we found that statistical connectivity predicted an average of 74 \$\\pm\$ 2.7\% (mean \$\\pm\$ {SEM}) synapse location distributions for nine types of cortical connections. This finding suggests that chemospecific attractive and repulsive mechanisms generally do not result in pairwise-specific connectivity. In some cases, however, the predicted distributions do not match precisely, indicating that chemospecific steering and aligning of the arbors may occur for some types of connections. This finding suggests that random alignment of axonal and dendritic arbors provides a sufficient foundation for specific functional connectivity to emerge in local neural microcircuits.},

@article{Deger12,
	Abstract = {Structural plasticity governs the long-term development of synaptic connections in the neocortex. While the underlying processes at the synapses are not fully understood, there is strong evidence that a process of random, independent formation and pruning of excitatory synapses can be ruled out. Instead, there must be some cooperation between the synaptic contacts connecting a single pre- and postsynaptic neuron pair. So far, the mechanism of cooperation is not known. Here we demonstrate that local correlation detection at the postsynaptic dendritic spine suffices to explain the synaptic cooperation effect, without assuming any hypothetical direct interaction pathway between the synaptic contacts. Candidate biomolecular mechanisms for dendritic correlation detection have been identified previously, as well as for structural plasticity based thereon. By analyzing and fitting of a simple model, we show that spike-timing correlation dependent structural plasticity, without additional mechanisms of cross-synapse interaction, can reproduce the experimentally observed distributions of numbers of synaptic contacts between pairs of neurons in the neocortex. Furthermore, the model yields a first explanation for the existence of both transient and persistent dendritic spines and allows to make predictions for future experiments. Structural plasticity has been observed even in the adult mammalian neocortex -- in seemingly static neuronal circuits structural remodeling is continuously at work. Still, it has been shown that the connection patterns between pairs of neurons are not random. In contrast, there is evidence that the synaptic contacts between a pair of neurons cooperate: several experimental studies report either zero or about 3--6 synapses between neuron pairs. The mechanism by which the synapses cooperate, however, has not yet been identified. Here we propose a model for structural plasticity that relies on local processes at the dendritic spine. We combine and extend the previous models and determine the equilibrium probability distribution of synaptic contact numbers of the model. By optimizing the parameters numerically for each of three reference datasets, we obtain equilibrium contact number distributions that fit the references very well. We conclude that the local dendritic mechanisms that we assume suffice to explain the cooperative synapse formation in the neocortex.},

@article{Reynaud12,
	Abstract = {To efficiently drive many behaviors, sensory systems have to integrate the activity of large neuronal populations within a limited time window. These populations need to rapidly achieve a robust representation of the input image, probably through canonical computations such as divisive normalization. However, little is known about the dynamics of the corticocortical interactions implementing these rapid and robust computations. Here, we measured the real-time activity of a large neuronal population in V1 using voltage-sensitive dye imaging in behaving monkeys. We found that contrast gain of the population increases over time with a time constant of ∼30 ms and propagates laterally over the cortical surface. This dynamic is well accounted for by a divisive normalization achieved through a recurrent network that transiently increases in size after response onset with a slow swelling speed of 0.007--0.014 m/s, suggesting a polysynaptic intracortical origin. In the presence of a surround, this normalization pool is gradually balanced by lateral inputs propagating from distant cortical locations. This results in a centripetal propagation of surround suppression at a speed of 0.1--0.3 m/s, congruent with horizontal intracortical axons speed. We propose that a simple generalized normalization scheme can account for both the dynamical contrast response function through recurrent polysynaptic intracortical loops and for the surround suppression through long-range monosynaptic horizontal spread. Our results demonstrate that V1 achieves a rapid and robust context-dependent input normalization through a timely push--pull between local and lateral networks. We suggest that divisive normalization, a fundamental canonical computation, should be considered as a dynamic process.},

@article{Torres-Sosa12,
	Abstract = {
                Accumulating experimental evidence suggests that the gene regulatory networks of living organisms operate in the critical phase, namely, at the transition between ordered and chaotic dynamics. Such critical dynamics of the network permits the coexistence of robustness and flexibility which are necessary to ensure homeostatic stability (of a given phenotype) while allowing for switching between multiple phenotypes (network states) as occurs in development and in response to environmental change. However, the mechanisms through which genetic networks evolve such critical behavior have remained elusive. Here we present an evolutionary model in which criticality naturally emerges from the need to balance between the two essential components of evolvability: phenotype conservation and phenotype innovation under mutations. We simulated the Darwinian evolution of random Boolean networks that mutate gene regulatory interactions and grow by gene duplication. The mutating networks were subjected to selection for networks that both (i) preserve all the already acquired phenotypes (dynamical attractor states) and (ii) generate new ones. Our results show that this interplay between extending the phenotypic landscape (innovation) while conserving the existing phenotypes (conservation) suffices to cause the evolution of all the networks in a population towards criticality. Furthermore, the networks produced by this evolutionary process exhibit structures with hubs (global regulators) similar to the observed topology of real gene regulatory networks. Thus, dynamical criticality and certain elementary topological properties of gene regulatory networks can emerge as a byproduct of the evolvability of the phenotypic landscape.

@article{Wuerger10,
	Abstract = {Many tasks involve the precise estimation of speed and position of moving objects, for instance to catch or avoid objects that cohabit in our environment. Many of these objects are characterised by signal representations in more than one modality, such as hearing and vision. The aim of this study was to investigate the extent to which the simultaneous presentation of auditory and visual signals enhances the estimation of motion speed and instantaneous position. Observers are asked to estimate the instant when a moving object arrives at a target spatial position by pressing a response button. This task requires observers to estimate the speed of the moving object and to calibrate the timing of their manual response such that it coincides with the true arrival time of the moving object. When both visual and auditory motion signals are available, the variability in estimating the arrival time of the moving object is significantly reduced compared to the variability in the unimodal conditions. This reduction in variability is consistent with optimal integration of the auditory and visual speed signals. The average bias in the estimated arrival times depends on the motion speed: for medium speeds (17 deg/s) observers' subjective arrival times are earlier than the true arrival times; for high speeds (47 deg/s) observers exhibit a (much smaller) bias in the other direction. This speed-dependency suggests that the bias is due to an error in estimating the motion speeds rather than an error in calibrating the timing of the motor response. Finally, in this temporal localization task, the bias and variability show similar patterns for motion defined by vision, audition or both.},

@article{Graf03,
	Abstract = {{PURPOSE}: The human visual system often encounters situations in which moving objects disappear behind an occluding surface. In such situations it might be beneficial to predict where the object will emerge on the other side of the occluder. Here we investigate the information in the scene, and in the motion of the object, that is important to observers when performing such a task. {METHODS}: Observers were asked to track a small dot on the screen as it moved towards a vertical occluder, which was clearly visible. The point initially moved purely horizontally. At subsequent time steps the speed was held constant while the direction of the velocity was sampled from a unimodal probability distribution which was symmetric about the current direction. As soon as the dot reached the occluder it disappeared. Observers were asked to estimate where the dot would emerge on the other side of the occluder, as well as indicate a vertical interval around that point that they were certain would capture the dot as it emerged. Between trials the variance of the direction distribution was changed, increasing or decreasing the 'randomness' of the path. Occluder width and dot speed were also manipulated between trials. {RESULTS}: We found that observers increased the size of the capture region as the variance of the direction distribution increased. The capture region also increased in size with increasing occluder width, however, we found no effect of speed. {CONCLUSIONS}: Human observers extrapolate motion by integrating what is known about the characteristics of the path with information about the scene. We discuss and model this data in terms of a probabilistic account of motion perception.},

Altering retinal activity can disrupt eye-specific segregation, but little is known about the temporal features of binocular activity that modulate visual map development. We used optogenetic techniques to directly manipulate retinal activity in vivo and identified a critical period before eye opening in mice when specific binocular features of retinal activity drive visual map development. Synchronous activation of both eyes disrupted segregation, whereas asynchronous stimulation enhanced segregation. The optogenetic stimulus applied was spatially homogenous; accordingly, retinotopy of ipsilateral projections was markedly perturbed, but contralateral retinotopy was unaffected or even improved. These results provide direct evidence that the synchrony and precise temporal pattern of binocular retinal activity during a critical period in development regulates eye-specific segregation and retinotopy in the developing visual system.},

@article{Baylor74,
	Abstract = {1. The linear response of turtle cones to weak flashes or steps of light was usually well fitted by equations based on a chain of six or seven reactions with time constants varying over about a 6-fold range.2. The temperature coefficient (Q(10)) of the reciprocal of the time to peak of the response to a flash was 1.8 (15-25 degrees C), corresponding to an activation energy of 10 kcal/mole.3. Electrical measurements with one internal electrode and a balancing circuit gave the following results on red-sensitive cones of high resistance: resistance across cell surface in dark 50-170 {MOmega}; time constant in dark 4-6.5 msec. The effect of a bright light was to increase the resistance and time constant by 10-30\%.4. If the cell time constant, resting potential and maximum hyperpolarization are known, the fraction of ionic channels blocked by light at any instant can be calculated from the hyperpolarization and its rate of change. At times less than 50 msec the shape of this relation is consistent with the idea that the concentration of a blocking molecule which varies linearly with light intensity is in equilibrium with the fraction of ionic channels blocked.5. The rising phase of the response to flashes and steps of light covering a 10(5)-fold range of intensities is well fitted by a theory in which the essential assumptions are that (i) light starts a linear chain of reactions leading to the production of a substance which blocks ionic channels in the outer segment, (ii) an equilibrium between the blocking molecules and unblocked channels is established rapidly, and (iii) the electrical properties of the cell can be represented by a simple circuit with a time constant in the dark of about 6 msec.6. Deviations from the simple theory which occur after 50 msec are attributed partly to a time-dependent desensitization mechanism and partly to a change in saturation potential resulting from a voltage-dependent change in conductance.7. The existence of several components in the relaxation of the potential to its resting level can be explained by supposing that the ;substance' which blocks light sensitive ionic channels is inactivated in a series of steps.},

	Abstract = {1. Visual transduction in macaque cones was studied by measuring the membrane current of single outer segments projecting from small pieces of retina. 2. The response to a brief flash of light was diphasic and resembled the output of a bandpass filter with a peak frequency near 5 Hz. After the initial reduction in dark current there was a rebound increase which resulted from an increase in the number of open light-sensitive channels. The response to a step of light consisted of a prominent initial peak followed by a steady phase of smaller amplitude. 3. Responses to dim light were linear and time-invariant, suggesting that responses to single photons were linearly additive. From the flash sensitivity and the effective collecting area the peak amplitude of the single photon response was estimated as about 30 {fA}. 4. With flashes of increasing strength the photocurrent amplitude usually saturated along a curve that was gentler than an exponential but steeper than a Michaelis relation. The response reached the half-saturating amplitude at roughly 650 photoisomerizations. 5. The response-intensity relation was flatter in the steady state than shortly after a light step was turned on, indicating that bright light desensitized the transduction with a delay. This desensitization was not due to a reduction in pigment content. In the steady state, a background of intensity I lowered the sensitivity to a weak incremental test flash by a factor 1/(1 + {I/IO}), where {IO} was about 2.6 x 10(4) photoisomerizations s-1, or about 3.3 log trolands for the red- and green-sensitive cones. 6. Bleaching exposures produced permanent reductions in flash sensitivity but had little effect on the kinetics or saturating amplitude of subsequent flash responses. The sensitivity reductions were consistent with the expected reductions in visual pigment content and gave photosensitivities of about 8 x 10(-9) microns2 (free solution value) for the red- and green-sensitive pigments. During a steady bleaching exposure the final exponential decline of the photocurrent had a rate constant given by the product of the light intensity and the photosensitivity. 7. In some cells it was possible to measure a light-induced increase in current noise. The power spectrum of the noise resembled the spectrum of the dim flash response and the magnitude of the noise was consistent with a single photon response roughly 20 {fA} in size. 8. The membrane current recorded in darkness was noisy, with a variance near 0.12 {pA2} in the band 0-20 {Hz.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Grzywacz95,
	Abstract = {A recent challenge to the completeness of some influential models of local-motion detection has come from experiments in which subjects had to detect a single dot moving along a trajectory amidst noise dots undergoing Brownian motion. We propose and test a new theory of the detection and measurement of visual motion, which can account for these {signal-in-Brownian}-noise experiments. The theory postulates that the signals from local-motion detectors are made coherent in space and time by a special purpose network, and that this coherence boosts signals of features moving along non-random trajectories over time. Two experiments were performed to estimate parameters and test the theory. These experiments showed that detection is impaired with increasing eccentricity, an effect that varies inversely with step size. They also showed that detection improves over durations extending to at least 600 msec. An implementation of the theory accounts for these psychophysical detection measurements.},

@article{Anstis87,
	Abstract = {Four dots in an imaginary diamond were flashed in succession to give ambiguous apparent motion ({AM}). The top and bottom dots were flashed at time t1 and replaced by the left and right dots at time t2. If two priming dots were flashed beforehand at time t0 in line with two parallel sides of the diamond, {AM} was seen along those sides. We call this '' visual inertia''. The amount of visual inertia (measured by a null method) fell off with increasing angle between the priming dot and the side of the diamond. Visual inertia was still seen when the priming dots were presented to one eye and the test dots to the other, so the effect must be partly central. The timing and length of the priming path made little difference to visual inertia. However, static priming dots were ineffective. We conclude that the visual system was examining at least three successive time frames in deciding which items in one frame correspond with which items in succeeding frames.},

@article{Hogendoorn08a,
	Abstract = {An object moving in discrete steps can appear to move continuously even along sections of the path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent motion display, which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded {2AFC} task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers' reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent motion display is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, and that it is possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object's representation.},

@article{Makin09,
	Abstract = {Previous research suggests that there is overlap between the systems used for tracking visible and occluded moving targets. Both visually derived and stored velocity information provide input to the tracking system when the target is visible, but after occlusion the system receives its input solely from stored velocity representations. We used {EEG} to investigate the transition to purely memory guided tracking after the initial period of occlusion. Participants fixated while they covertly tracked targets moving horizontally rightward at velocities of 12 or 20 degrees. The targets were either continuously visible or disappeared for a short interval mid trajectory. Similar positive event related components were recorded over the right occipitoparietal region in both tasks, providing further evidence that the same neural systems are involved in tracking both visible and occluded targets. Furthermore, when the target was visible, the development of this positivity was linked to the spatial location of the target, peaking earlier in the 20 degrees condition. However, in the occluded condition the positive deflection began around 200 ms following the onset of occlusion and was not modulated by target velocity or location. This indicates a neural response after occlusion is cortically registered, consistent with the hypothesis that there is increased reliance on memory guided tracking at this point.},

Here we address the question whether changes in stimulus contrast also affect smooth pursuit eye movements. Subjects were asked to smoothly track a moving Gabor patch. Targets varied in velocity (1, 8, and 15 deg/s), spatial frequency (0.1, 1, 4, and 8 c/deg), and contrast, ranging from just below individual thresholds to maximum contrast. Results show that smooth pursuit eye velocity gain rose significantly with increasing contrast. Below a contrast level of two to three times threshold, pursuit gain, acceleration, latency, and positional accuracy were severely impaired. Therefore, the smooth pursuit motor response shows the same kind of slowing at low contrast that was demonstrated in previous studies on perception.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

They interpreted this as refutation of efficient coding models, which require oriented input in order to develop oriented receptive fields. Here we show that these data are compatible with the efficient coding hypothesis if the influence of spontaneous retinal waves is considered. We demonstrate that independent component analysis learns predominantly oriented receptive fields when trained on a mixture of spot stimuli and spontaneous retinal waves. Further, we show that the efficient coding hypothesis provides a compelling explanation for the contrast between the lack of receptive field changes seen in animals reared with spot stimuli and the significant cortical reorganisation observed in stripe-reared animals.},

@article{Rahnev12,
	Abstract = {The relationship between accuracy and confidence in psychophysical tasks traditionally has been assumed to be mainly positive, i.e., the two typically increase or decrease together. However, recent studies have reported examples of exceptions, where confidence and accuracy dissociate from each other. Explanations for such dissociations often involve dual-channel models, in which a cortical channel contributes to both accuracy and confidence, whereas a subcortical channel only contributes to accuracy. Here, we show that a single-channel model derived from signal detection theory ({SDT}) can also account for such dissociations. We applied transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) to the occipital cortex to disrupt the internal representation of a visual stimulus. The results showed that consistent with previous research, occipital {TMS} decreased accuracy. However, counterintuitively, it also led to an increase in confidence ratings. The data were predicted well by a single-channel {SDT} model, which posits that occipital {TMS} increased the variance of the internal stimulus distributions. A formal model comparison analysis that used information theoretic methods confirmed that this model was preferred over single-channel models, in which occipital {TMS} changed the signal strength or dual-channel models, which assume two different processing routes. Thus our results show that dissociations between accuracy and confidence can, at least in some cases, be accounted for by a single-channel model.},

	Abstract = {Theoretical studies of mammalian cortex argue that efficient neural codes should be sparse. However, theoretical and experimental studies have used different definitions of the term "sparse" leading to three assumptions about the nature of sparse codes. First, codes that have high lifetime sparseness require few action potentials. Second, lifetime-sparse codes are also population-sparse. Third, neural codes are optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. Here, we examine these assumptions in detail and test their validity in primate visual cortex. We show that lifetime and population sparseness are not necessarily correlated and that a code may have high lifetime sparseness regardless of how many action potentials it uses. We measure lifetime sparseness during presentation of natural images in three areas of macaque visual cortex, V1, V2, and V4. We find that lifetime sparseness does not increase across the visual hierarchy. This suggests that the neural code is not simply optimized to maximize lifetime sparseness. We also find that firing rates during a challenging visual task are higher than theoretical values based on metabolic limits and that responses in V1, V2, and V4 are well-described by exponential distributions. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that neurons are optimized to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic constraints on mean firing rate.},

@article{Blattler11,
	Abstract = {To what extent are sensory responses in the brain compatible with first-order principles? The efficient coding hypothesis projects that neurons use as few spikes as possible to faithfully represent natural stimuli. However, many sparsely firing neurons in higher brain areas seem to violate this hypothesis in that they respond more to familiar stimuli than to nonfamiliar stimuli. We reconcile this discrepancy by showing that efficient sensory responses give rise to stimulus selectivity that depends on the stimulus-independent firing threshold and the balance between excitatory and inhibitory inputs. We construct a cost function that enforces minimal firing rates in model neurons by linearly punishing suprathreshold synaptic currents. By contrast, subthreshold currents are punished quadratically, which allows us to optimally reconstruct sensory inputs from elicited responses. We train synaptic currents on many renditions of a particular bird's own song ({BOS}) and few renditions of conspecific birds' songs ({CONs}). During training, model neurons develop a response selectivity with complex dependence on the firing threshold. At low thresholds, they fire densely and prefer {CON} and the reverse {BOS} ({REV}) over {BOS}. However, at high thresholds or when hyperpolarized, they fire sparsely and prefer {BOS} over {REV} and over {CON}. Based on this selectivity reversal, our model suggests that preference for a highly familiar stimulus corresponds to a high-threshold or strong-inhibition regime of an efficient coding strategy. Our findings apply to songbird mirror neurons, and in general, they suggest that the brain may be endowed with simple mechanisms to rapidly change selectivity of neural responses to focus sensory processing on either familiar or nonfamiliar stimuli. In summary, we find support for the efficient coding hypothesis and provide new insights into the interplay between the sparsity and selectivity of neural responses.},

	Abstract = {The mathematical structure of the widely popular Sudoku puzzles is akin to typical hard constraint satisfaction problems that lie at the heart of many applications, including protein folding and the general problem of finding the ground state of a glassy spin system. Via an exact mapping of Sudoku into a deterministic, continuous-time dynamical system, here we show that the difficulty of Sudoku translates into transient chaotic behavior exhibited by the dynamical system. In particular, we show that the escape rate \\$\\kappa\\$, an invariant characteristic of transient chaos, provides a single scalar measure of the puzzle's hardness, which correlates well with human difficulty level ratings. Accordingly, \\$\\eta = -\\log\_{10}{\\kappa}\\$ can be used to define a "Richter"-type scale for puzzle hardness, with easy puzzles falling in the range \\$0 \&lt; \\eta \\leq 1\\$, medium ones within \\$1 \&lt; \\eta \\leq 2\\$, hard in \\$2 \&lt; \\eta \\leq 3\\$ and ultra-hard with \\$\\eta \&gt; 3\\$. To our best knowledge, there are no known puzzles with \\$\\eta \&gt; 4\\$.},

	Abstract = {The -function and the -function are phenomenological models that are widely used in the context of timing interceptive actions and collision avoidance, respectively. Both models were previously considered to be unrelated to each other: is a decreasing function that provides an estimation of time-to-contact (ttc) in the early phase of an object approach; in contrast, has a maximum before ttc. Furthermore, it is not clear how both functions could be implemented at the neuronal level in a biophysically plausible fashion. Here we propose a new framework -- the corrected modified Tau function -- capable of predicting both -type ( '' '') and -type ( '' '') responses. The outstanding property of our new framework is its resilience to noise. We show that can be derived from a firing rate equation, and, as , serves to describe the response curves of collision sensitive neurons. Furthermore, we show that predicts the psychophysical performance of subjects determining ttc. Our new framework is thus validated successfully against published and novel experimental data. Within the framework, links between -type and -type neurons are established. Therefore, it could possibly serve as a model for explaining the co-occurrence of such neurons in the brain. In 1957, Sir Fred Hoyle published a science fiction novel in which he described humanity's encounter with an extraterrestrial life form. It came in the shape of a huge black cloud which approached the earth. Hoyle proposed a formula ( '' '') for computing the remaining time until contact ( '' ttc'') of the cloud with the earth. Nowadays in real science, serves as a model for ttc -perception for animals and humans, although it is not entirely undisputed. For instance, seems to be incompatible with a collision-sensitive neuron in locusts (the Lobula Giant Movement Detector or {LGMD} neuron). {LGMD} neurons are instead better described by the -function, which differs from . Here we propose a generic model ( '' '') that contains and as special cases. The validity of the model was confirmed with a psychophysical experiment. Also, we fitted many published response curves of {LGMD} neurons with our new model and with the -function. Both models fit these response curves well, and we thus can conclude that and possibly result from a generic neuronal circuit template such as it is described by .},

	Abstract = {Our eyes are constantly in motion. Even during visual fixation, small eye movements continually jitter the location of gaze. It is known that visual percepts tend to fade when retinal image motion is eliminated in the laboratory. However, it has long been debated whether, during natural viewing, fixational eye movements have functions in addition to preventing the visual scene from fading. In this study, we analysed the influence in humans of fixational eye movements on the discrimination of gratings masked by noise that has a power spectrum similar to that of natural images. Using a new method of retinal image stabilization, we selectively eliminated the motion of the retinal image that normally occurs during the intersaccadic intervals of visual fixation. Here we show that fixational eye movements improve discrimination of high spatial frequency stimuli, but not of low spatial frequency stimuli. This improvement originates from the temporal modulations introduced by fixational eye movements in the visual input to the retina, which emphasize the high spatial frequency harmonics of the stimulus. In a natural visual world dominated by low spatial frequencies, fixational eye movements appear to constitute an effective sampling strategy by which the visual system enhances the processing of spatial detail.},

@article{Schaal07,
	Abstract = {In the past, computational motor control has been approached from at least two major frameworks: the dynamic systems approach and the viewpoint of optimal control. The dynamic system approach emphasizes motor control as a process of self-organization between an animal and its environment. Nonlinear differential equations that can model entrainment and synchronization behavior are among the most favorable tools of dynamic systems modelers. In contrast, optimal control approaches view motor control as the evolutionary or development result of a nervous system that tries to optimize rather general organizational principles, e.g., energy consumption or accurate task achievement. Optimal control theory is usually employed to develop appropriate theories. Interestingly, there is rather little interaction between dynamic systems and optimal control modelers as the two approaches follow rather different philosophies and are often viewed as diametrically opposing. In this paper, we develop a computational approach to motor control that offers a unifying modeling framework for both dynamic systems and optimal control approaches. In discussions of several behavioral experiments and some theoretical and robotics studies, we demonstrate how our computational ideas allow both the representation of self-organizing processes and the optimization of movement based on reward criteria. Our modeling framework is rather simple and general, and opens opportunities to revisit many previous modeling results from this novel unifying view.},

@article{Feldman09,
	Abstract = {According to a view that has dominated the field for over a century, the brain programs muscle commands and uses a copy of these commands [efference copy ({EC})] to adjust not only resulting motor action but also ongoing perception. This view was helpful in formulating several classical problems of action and perception: (1) the posture-movement problem of how movements away from a stable posture can be made without evoking resistance of posture-stabilizing mechanisms resulting from intrinsic muscle and reflex properties; (2) the problem of kinesthesia or why our sense of limb position is good despite ambiguous positional information delivered by proprioceptive and cutaneous signals; (3) the problem of visual space constancy or why the world is perceived as stable while its retinal image shifts following changes in gaze. On closer inspection, the {EC} theory actually does not solve these problems in a physiologically feasible way. Here solutions to these problems are proposed based on the advanced formulation of the equilibrium-point hypothesis that suggests that action and perception are accomplished in a common spatial frame of reference selected by the brain from a set of available frames. Experimental data suggest that the brain is also able to translate or/and rotate the selected frame of reference by modifying its major attributes-the origin, metrics and orientation-and thus substantially influence action and perception. Because of this ability, such frames are called physical to distinguish them from symbolic or mathematical frames that are used to describe system behavior without influencing this behavior. Experimental data also imply that once a frame of reference is chosen, its attributes are modified in a feedforward way, thus enabling the brain to act in an anticipatory and predictive manner. This approach is extended to sense of effort, kinesthetic illusions, phantom limb and phantom body phenomena. It also addresses the question of why retinal images of objects are sensed as objects located in the external, physical world, rather than in internal representations of the brain.},

	Abstract = {Background: Evidence supports an association between liability to schizophrenia and smooth-pursuit eye movement ({SPEM}) abnormalities. Knowledge of the biological mechanisms of {SPEM} abnormalities may provide critical insights into the etiology of schizophrenia. {SPEM} is elicited by sensory motor information from the movement of the object's image on the retina (retinal motion signal) and subsequent extraretinal motion signals. Previous studies suggest that a deficit in predictive responses to extraretinal motion signals may underlie the {SPEM} phenotype in schizophrenia. Data suggest that at-risk individuals for schizophrenia depend less on extraretinal and more on retinal motion signals to maintain pursuit than healthy individuals. Methods: We designed a pursuit task that employs unexpected changes in target direction during smooth pursuit. The unpredictable task is unique in that performance is expected to be better if the subject's response is biased towards retinal motion. Results: The study included 23 schizophrenia patients and 22 normal controls. Results showed that schizophrenia patients showed significantly superior performance (i.e. higher smooth pursuit gain) for a brief period after an unexpected change in target direction compared with healthy subjects. Conclusion: Findings of superior performance by schizophrenic patients are interesting because they circumvent confounds of generalized deficits. These results provide further evidence of specific deficit in the predictive pursuit mechanism and over-reliance on retinal error signals to maintain pursuit in schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {Smooth eye pursuit is believed to involve the integration of an extraretinal signal formed by an internal representation of the moving target and a retinal signal using the visual feedback to evaluate performance. A variation of the smooth eye pursuit paradigm (in which the moving target is occluded for a short period of time and subjects are asked to continue tracking) designed to isolate the predictive processes that drive the extraretinal signal was performed by 1,187 young men. The latency to the onset of change in pursuit speed, the time of decelerating eye-movement speed and the steady state residual gain were measured for each subject and correlated with measures of other oculomotor (closed-loop smooth eye pursuit, saccade, antisaccade, active fixation) and cognitive tasks (measuring sustained attention and working memory). Deceleration time increased with increasing age, while education, general {IQ} and cognitive variables had no effect on predictive pursuit performance. Predictive pursuit indices were correlated to those of closed-loop pursuit and antisaccade performance, but these correlations were very weak except for a positive correlation of residual gain to saccade frequency in the fixation task with distracters. This correlation suggested that the maintenance of active fixation is negatively correlated with the ability to maintain predictive pursuit speed. In conclusion, this study presents predictive pursuit performance in a large sample of apparently healthy individuals. Surprisingly, predictive pursuit was weakly if at all related to closed-loop pursuit or other oculomotor and cognitive tasks, supporting the usefulness of this phenotype in the study of frontal lobe integrity in normal and patient populations.},

	Abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction is considered to be a valid schizophrenia endophenotype. Recent studies have tried to refine the phenotype in order to identify the specific neurophysiological deficits associated with schizophrenia. We used a variation of the smooth eye pursuit paradigm, during which the moving target is occluded for a short period of time and subjects are asked to continue tracking. This is designed to isolate the predictive processes that drive the extraretinal signal, a process previously reported to be defective in schizophrenia patients as well as their healthy relatives. In the current study, we investigated the relationship between predictive pursuit performance indices and age, education, non-verbal {IQ}, schizotypy and state anxiety, depression in 795 young Greek military conscripts. State anxiety was related to better predictive pursuit performance (increase in residual pursuit gain), while disorganized schizotypy was related to deficient predictive pursuit performance (decreased residual gain). This effect was independent of the effect of disorganized schizotypy on other oculomotor functions supporting the hypothesis that predictive pursuit might be specifically affected in schizophrenia spectrum disorders and could be considered as a distinct oculomotor endophenotype.},

	Abstract = {How much about our interactions with---and experience of---our world can be deduced from basic principles? This paper reviews recent attempts to understand the self-organised behaviour of embodied agents, like ourselves, as satisfying basic imperatives for sustained exchanges with the environment. In brief, one simple driving force appears to explain many aspects of perception, action and the perception of action. This driving force is the minimisation of surprise or prediction error, which---in the context of perception---corresponds to Bayes-optimal predictive coding (that suppresses exteroceptive prediction errors) and---in the context of action---reduces to classical motor reflexes (that suppress proprioceptive prediction errors). In what follows, we look at some of the phenomena that emerge from this single principle, such as the perceptual encoding of spatial trajectories that can both generate movement (of self) and recognise the movements (of others). These emergent behaviours rest upon prior beliefs about itinerant (wandering) states of the world---but where do these beliefs come from? In this paper, we focus on the nature of prior beliefs and how they underwrite the active sampling of a spatially extended sensorium. Put simply, to avoid surprising states of the world, it is necessary to minimise uncertainty about those states. When this minimisation is implemented via prior beliefs---about how we sample the world---the resulting behaviour is remarkably reminiscent of searches seen in foraging or visual searches with saccadic eye movements.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a variational free-energy formulation of (partially observable) Markov decision problems in decision making under uncertainty. We show that optimal control can be cast as active inference. In active inference, both action and posterior beliefs about hidden states minimise a free energy bound on the negative log-likelihood of observed states, under a generative model. In this setting, reward or cost functions are absorbed into prior beliefs about state transitions and terminal states. Effectively, this converts optimal control into a pure inference problem, enabling the application of standard Bayesian filtering techniques. We then consider optimal trajectories that rest on posterior beliefs about hidden states in the future. Crucially, this entails modelling control as a hidden state that endows the generative model with a representation of agency. This leads to a distinction between models with and without inference on hidden control states; namely, agency-free and agency-based models, respectively.},

We analysed the time course of the globe's return after horizontal displacements in three rhesus monkeys lightly anaesthetised with ketamine.

The two long time-constant terms accounted for 25\% of plant compliance, and led to a model that accounted for hitherto unexplained features of ocular motoneuron firing such as (i) hysteresis, and (ii) the inability of a 2 time-constant model to fit data for both fast and slow eye-movements.},

@article{Friston03a,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present an approach to the identification of nonlinear input-state-output systems. By using a bilinear approximation to the dynamics of interactions among states, the parameters of the implicit causal model reduce to three sets. These comprise (1) parameters that mediate the influence of extrinsic inputs on the states, (2) parameters that mediate intrinsic coupling among the states, and (3) [bilinear] parameters that allow the inputs to modulate that coupling. Identification proceeds in a Bayesian framework given known, deterministic inputs and the observed responses of the system. We developed this approach for the analysis of effective connectivity using experimentally designed inputs and {fMRI} responses. In this context, the coupling parameters correspond to effective connectivity and the bilinear parameters reflect the changes in connectivity induced by inputs. The ensuing framework allows one to characterise {fMRI} experiments, conceptually, as an experimental manipulation of integration among brain regions (by contextual or trial-free inputs, like time or attentional set) that is revealed using evoked responses (to perturbations or trial-bound inputs, like stimuli). As with previous analyses of effective connectivity, the focus is on experimentally induced changes in coupling (cf., psychophysiologic interactions). However, unlike previous approaches in neuroimaging, the causal model ascribes responses to designed deterministic inputs, as opposed to treating inputs as unknown and stochastic.},

@article{Freyberg08,
	Abstract = {A fundamental problem in the generation of goal-directed behaviour is caused by the inevitable latency of biological sensory systems. Behaviour which is fully synchronised with the triggering sensory event can only be executed if the occurrence of this event can be predicted based on prior information. Smooth-pursuit eye movements are a classical and well-established example of goal-directed behaviour. The execution of these eye movements is thought to be very closely linked to the processing of visual motion signals. Here, we show that healthy human subjects as well as trained rhesus monkeys are able to initiate smooth-pursuit eye movements in anticipation of a moving target. These anticipatory pursuit eye movements are scaled to the velocity of the expected target. Furthermore, we can exclude the possibility that anticipatory pursuit is simply an after-pursuit of the previous trial. Visually-guided pursuit is only marginally affected by the presence of a structured background. However, the presence of a structured background severely impedes the ability to perform anticipatory pursuit. More generally, our data provide additional evidence that the cognitive oculomotor repertoires of human and monkeys are similar, at least with respect of smooth-pursuit in the prediction of an appearing target.},

@article{Arnold09,
	Abstract = {When a brief static flash is presented in physical alignment with a moving target, the position of the flash can seem to lag behind that of the moving target. Various explanations exist. One of the most popular is the differential latency hypothesis. This assumes that neural latencies for moving stimuli are shorter than those for static stimuli. Accordingly, the flash lag would occur because perception is temporally fragmented, with moving stimuli seen before static. To test this, observers were asked to make different judgments concerning the same stimulus. Observers either judged if color changes in moving and static stimulus sections were synchronous, or whether the different stimulus sections were aligned at the time of a color change. If the flash-lag were driven by a simple differential latency, we would expect both judgments to be marked by a temporal advantage for moving stimuli. Our results suggest the contrary, as only the later judgment was marked by a flash-lag effect. The apparent timing of moving and static color changes was veridical. However, when we introduced a systematic differential latency, by modulating image contrast, both judgments were affected. Our data therefore suggest that a simple differential can modulate flash-lag type effects, but they do not cause the phenomenon.},

@article{Inui06,
	Abstract = {We previously examined the cortical processing in response to somatosensory, auditory and noxious stimuli, using magnetoencephalography in humans. Here, we performed a similar analysis of the processing in the human visual cortex for comparative purposes. After flash stimuli applied to the right eye, activations were found in eight cortical areas: the left medial occipital area around the calcarine fissure (primary visual cortex, V1), the left dorsomedial area around the parietooccipital sulcus ({DM}), the ventral ({MOv}) and dorsal ({MOd}) parts of the middle occipital area of bilateral hemispheres, the left temporo-occipito-parietal cortex corresponding to human {MT}/V5 ({hMT}), and the ventral surface of the medial occipital area ({VO}) of the bilateral hemispheres. The mean onset latencies of each cortical activity were (in ms): 27.5 (V1), 31.8 ({DM}), 32.8 (left {MOv}), 32.2 (right {MOv}), 33.4 (left {MOd}), 32.3 (right {MOv}), 37.8 ({hMT}), 46.9 (left {VO}), and 46.4 (right {VO}). Therefore the cortico-cortical connection time of visual processing at the early stage was 4--6 ms, which is very similar to the time delay between sequential activations in somatosensory and auditory processing. In addition, the activities in V1, {MOd}, {DM}, and {hMT} showed a similar biphasic waveform with a reversal of polarity after 10 ms, which is a common activation profile of the cortical activity for somatosensory, auditory, and pain-evoked responses. These results suggest similar mechanisms of the serial cortico-cortical processing of sensory information among all sensory areas of the cortex.},

The MT is a small visual area that exists in the temporal lobe of all primates, including humans, containing neurons that are activated by moving stimuli. This region was labeled the homologue of monkey MT/V5 (Zeki et al. 1991) and is referred to as hMT. The Talairach coordinates of the hMT source in this study (lat 46, post 70, sup 8) are in good agreement with those reported in previous studies as a motion-selective area (Zeki et al. 1991: 38, 74, 8; Watson et al. 1993: 41, 69, 2; Tootell et al. 1995: 45, 76, 3; Sunaert et al. 1999: 45, 66, 3). Although MT is known to be involved in motion perception, this region also contains neurons that are activated by flash stimuli in monkeys (Schroeder et al. 1998). A previous VEP study (Buchner et al. 1997) demonstrated a component originating from the vicinity of V5 with a peak at around 45 ms, which is consistent with our results that the hMT source activity peaked at 44.8 ms. The possible contribution of V5 to an early period of VEPs (40--75 ms) was also reported by Morand et al. (2000). The onset latency of hMT was significantly longer than that for DM and MO and, in turn, the onset latencies for DM and MO were significantly longer than that for V1. Therefore we considered that hMT was the third stage of hierarchical processing, although MT receives direct projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus (Sincich et al. 2004) and V1 (Maunsell and Van Essen 1983; Zeki 1969) in monkeys. The latency difference of 9.9 ms between V1 and hMT seems too long for a serial activation between them, compared with the 4- to 6-ms time delay between V1 and MO or DM. In a single-unit recording study in macaques by Movshon and Newsome (1996), the response latency of V1 neurons antidromically activated by stimulation in MT was 1.0--1.7 ms. As possible areas responsible for the hMT activity in this study, V2 (Anderson and Martin 2002; Maunsell and Van Essen 1983; Ungerleider and Desimone 1986) and DM (Galletti et al. 2001; Wagor et al. 1975) have been shown to send projections to MT in monkeys. A CSD study of macaques using flash stimuli (Schroeder et al. 1998) found shorter average latencies for MT than for V1, which conflicts with the present results. Their results, as well as those by Raiguel et al. (1989), suggest the possibility that MT can be driven without a relay in V1. However, Schroeder et al. (1998) also found that the latencies in the peripheral retinal representation of V1 are the shortest subset of V1 latencies and are shorter than those in MT. When the shortest latency of V1 is compared with the latency of MT (see Fig. 13 in Schroeder et al. 1998), V1 is shorter than MT by about 6--9 ms, which is consistent with the present results. Because there are several lines of evidence both in monkeys and humans that motion-selective MT neurons can be activated without a relay in V1 (Barbur et al. 1993; Girard et al. 1992; Rodman et al. 1989; Sincich et al. 2004), the hMT source in the present study might represent activities of neurons that are different from neurons that are activated selectively by moving stimuli." ---=note-separator=--- of interest: "MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA (HMT).

When the shortest latency of V1 is compared with the latency of MT (see Fig. 13 in Schroeder et al. 1998), V1 is shorter than MT by about 6--9 ms, which is consistent with the present results. Because there are several lines of evidence both in monkeys and humans that motion-selective MT neurons can be activated without a relay in V1 (Barbur et al. 1993; Girard et al. 1992; Rodman et al. 1989; Sincich et al. 2004), the hMT source in the present study might represent activities of neurons that are different from neurons that are activated selectively by moving stimuli."},

@article{Lisberger87,
	Abstract = {The function of smooth pursuit is to keep the fovea pointed at a small visual target that moves smoothly across a patterned background. Chemical lesions, single cell recordings, and behavioral measures have shown that the cortical motion processing pathways form the afferent limb for pursuit. Important areas include at least the striate cortex and the middle temporal visual area, and probably the medial superior temporal visual area and the posterior parietal cortex. We argue that the visual inputs are transmitted through a simple sensory motor interface in the pons, to the efferent limb in the brain stem and cerebellum. The efferent limb uses neural velocity memory to maintain pursuit automatically. We present evidence that the velocity memory is provided, at least in part, by eye velocity positive feedback between the flocculus of the cerebellum and the brain stem. Finally, we use a computer model to show how the maintenance of pursuit can be simulated on a millisecond time scale. The structure and internal elements of the model are based on the biological experiments reviewed in our paper. In the past five years, progress on the neural basis of pursuit eye movements has been rapid. Several areas of research have made substantial contributions, by using combinations of new and conventional methods. Many of the pathways that contribute to pursuit have been identified, and their physiological activity and functions are becoming understood. Continuing progress promises to yield an understanding of one specific form of visually guided movement, at the level of neuronal circuits and behavior, in the primate.},

	Abstract = {The ventral visual pathway achieves object and face recognition by building transformation-invariant representations from elementary visual features. In previous computer simulation studies with rate-coded neural networks, the development of transformation-invariant representations has been demonstrated using either of two biologically plausible learning mechanisms, Trace learning and Continuous Transformation ({CT}) learning. However, it has not previously been investigated how transformation-invariant representations may be learned in a more biologically accurate spiking neural network. A key issue is how the synaptic connection strengths in such a spiking network might self-organize through {Spike-Time} Dependent Plasticity ({STDP}) where the change in synaptic strength is dependent on the relative times of the spikes emitted by the presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons rather than simply correlated activity driving changes in synaptic efficacy. Here we present simulations with conductance-based integrate-and-fire ({IF}) neurons using a {STDP} learning rule to address these gaps in our understanding. It is demonstrated that with the appropriate selection of model parameters and training regime, the spiking network model can utilize either Trace-like or {CT}-like learning mechanisms to achieve transform-invariant representations.},

	Abstract = {Offering proper evaluation methodology is essential to continue progress in modelling the neural mechanisms involved in vision information processing. Currently the evaluation of biologically inspired motion estimation models lacks a proper methodology for comparing their performance against behavioural and psychophysical data. Here we set the basis for such a new benchmark methodology based on human visual performance and designed a database of image sequences taken from neuroscience and psychophysics literature. In this article we focused on two fundamental aspects of motion estimation, which are the respective influence between 1d versus 2d cues and the dynamics of motion integration. Since motion models deal with many kinds of motion representations and scales, we defined two general readouts based on a global motion estimation. Such readouts, namely eye movements and perceived motion, will serve as a reference to compare simulated and experimental data. Baseline results are provided for biologically inspired artificial vision models but also for computer vision models. As a whole we provide here the basis for a valuable evaluation methodology to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of motion perception in the visual cortex.

	Abstract = {It is well-established that some aspects of perception and action can be understood as probabilistic inferences over underlying probability distributions. In some situations, it would be advantageous for the nervous system to sample interpretations from a probability distribution rather than commit to a particular interpretation. In this study, we asked whether visual percepts correspond to samples from the probability distribution over image interpretations, a form of sampling that we refer to as Bayesian sampling. To test this idea, we manipulated pairs of sensory cues in a bistable display consisting of two superimposed moving drifting gratings, and we asked subjects to report their perceived changes in depth ordering. We report that the fractions of dominance of each percept follow the multiplicative rule predicted by Bayesian sampling. Furthermore, we show that attractor neural networks can sample probability distributions if input currents add linearly and encode probability distributions with probabilistic population codes.},

                Behavior varies from trial to trial even when the stimulus is maintained as constant as possible. In many models, this variability is attributed to noise in the brain. Here, we propose that there is another major source of variability: suboptimal inference. Importantly, we argue that in most tasks of interest, and particularly complex ones, suboptimal inference is likely to be the dominant component of behavioral variability. This perspective explains a variety of intriguing observations, including why variability appears to be larger on the sensory than on the motor side, and why our sensors are sometimes surprisingly unreliable.

@article{Zhi11,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a novel graph-preserving sparse nonnegative matrix factorization ({GSNMF}) algorithm is proposed for facial expression recognition. The {GSNMF} algorithm is derived from the original {NMF} algorithm by exploiting both sparse and graph-preserving properties. The latter may contain the class information of the samples. Therefore, {GSNMF} can be conducted as an unsupervised or a supervised dimension reduction method. A sparse representation of the facial images is obtained by minimizing the -norm of the basis images. Furthermore, according to the graph embedding theory, the neighborhood of the samples is preserved by retaining the graph structure in the mapped space. The {GSNMF} decomposition transforms the high-dimensional facial expression images into a locality-preserving subspace with sparse representation. To guarantee convergence, we use the projected gradient method to calculate the nonnegative solution of {GSNMF}. Experiments are conducted on the {JAFFE} database and the {Cohn-Kanade} database with unoccluded and partially occluded facial images. The results show that the {GSNMF} algorithm provides better facial representations and achieves higher recognition rates than nonnegative matrix factorization. Moreover, {GSNMF} is also more robust to partial occlusions than other tested methods.},

@article{Gori11,
	Abstract = {Parametric psychophysical investigations are reported for two related illusory effects that occur when viewing an elementary square-wave grating while making '' back and forth'' head movements along the projection line. Observers report a non-rigid distortion of the pattern, including: (i) an expansion in a direction perpendicular to the stripes, and (ii) a perceived curvature of the stripes. We investigated these two phenomena independently. The first depends on the classical physiological aperture problem that confronts early cells in the vision system. Interactions between ambiguous and unambiguous motion signals, generated at line interiors and line ends, respectively, can explain why the perceived expansion occurs only in directions perpendicular to the stripes. A simple model is presented and successfully tested by a nulling psychophysical experiment with four subjects. The experiment varies key stimulus attributes that generate ambiguous and unambiguous motion signals. Regarding the illusory curvature, a differential geometry model of the optics of our display, which identifies a non-classical three-dimensional ({3D}) aperture problem, is proposed (Yazdanbakhsh \& Gori, 2011). We tested that model by implementing its closed form prediction of distortion to design displays for a second psychophysical experiment that also uses a nulling technique. Results from four subjects allow the quantification of the degree of perceived curvature as a function of speed, distance and stimulus type (blurred vs. unblurred grating) and are compatible with the predictions of the model. \^{a}º Accordion Grating Illusion ({AGI}) is a new illusion of motion misperception. \^{a}º {AGI} presents 2 illusory distortions: an asymmetric expansion and a stripe curvature. \^{a}º The first distortion depends on the aperture problem based on early cells in V1. \^{a}º The second distortion can be explained by introducing a new concept: {3D} aperture problem. \^{a}º Two models are presented and successfully tested by psychophysical experiments.},

	Abstract = {Hubel and Wiesel began the modern study of development and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1), discovering response properties of cortical neurons that distinguished them from their inputs and that were arranged in a functional architecture. Their findings revealed an early innate period of development and a later critical period of dramatic experience-dependent plasticity. Recent studies have used rodents to benefit from biochemistry and genetics. The roles of spontaneous neural activity and molecular signaling in innate, experience-independent development have been clarified, as have the later roles of visual experience. Plasticity produced by monocular visual deprivation ({MD}) has been dissected into stages governed by distinct signaling mechanisms, some of whose molecular players are known. Many crucial questions remain, but new tools for perturbing cortical cells and measuring plasticity at the level of changes in connections among identified neurons now exist. The future for the study of V1 to illuminate cortical development and plasticity is bright. Espinosa and Stryker discuss the state of the field for our understanding of the development and plasticity of primary visual cortex (V1), placing this discussion within the context of the original work of Hubel and Wiesel.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of building high- level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 bil- lion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous {SGD} on a clus- ter with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental re- sults reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bod- ies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8\% accu- racy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from {ImageNet}, a leap of 70\% relative im- provement over the previous state-of-the-art.},

@article{Chen12,
	Abstract = {Differential Interference Contrast ({DIC}) microscopy is a common approach for researching the dynamics of cell behaviors. Segmentation of shape of erythrocyte (red blood cell) is the basis of quantitative analysis of its deformability and hence its filterability. Commonly used manual segmentation of shapes of individual cells from samples by human visual inspection requires a large amount of tedious work because it is time consuming and exhaustive. This makes automatic cell image analysis essential in biology studies. In this paper, a novel level set based technique, called Complex Local Phase based Subjective Surfaces ({CLAPSS}), is proposed for the segmentation of differential interference contrast ({DIC}) red blood cell microscopy images. Based on the framework of a generalized version of subjective surfaces ({GSUBSURF}), a complex local phase based edge indicator function is introduced to replace the traditional gradient based edge detector for the local image feature acquisition, which is the key for the evolution of the surface. In addition, we propose a new variation scheme for stretching factor to achieve relatively accurate segmentation results even if the reference point is located nearby cell boundaries. We show that the proposed method is more accurate and reliable than several existing methods in experiments.},

@article{Soltani12,
	Abstract = {Most utility theories of choice assume that the introduction of an irrelevant option (called the decoy) to a choice set does not change the preference between existing options. On the contrary, a wealth of behavioral data demonstrates the dependence of preference on the decoy and on the context in which the options are presented. Nevertheless, neural mechanisms underlying context-dependent preference are poorly understood. In order to shed light on these mechanisms, we design and perform a novel experiment to measure within-subject decoy effects. We find within-subject decoy effects similar to what have been shown previously with between-subject designs. More importantly, we find that not only are the decoy effects correlated, pointing to similar underlying mechanisms, but also these effects increase with the distance of the decoy from the original options. To explain these observations, we construct a plausible neuronal model that can account for decoy effects based on the trial-by-trial adjustment of neural representations to the set of available options. This adjustment mechanism, which we call range normalization, occurs when the nervous system is required to represent different stimuli distinguishably, while being limited to using bounded neural activity. The proposed model captures our experimental observations and makes new predictions about the influence of the choice set size on the decoy effects, which are in contrast to previous models of context-dependent choice preference. Critically, unlike previous psychological models, the computational resource required by our range-normalization model does not increase exponentially as the set size increases. Our results show that context-dependent choice behavior, which is commonly perceived as an irrational response to the presence of irrelevant options, could be a natural consequence of the biophysical limits of neural representation in the brain. While faced with a decision between two options for which you have no clear preference (say, a small cheap {TV} and a large expensive {TV}), you are presented with a new but inferior option (say, a medium expensive {TV}). The mere presence of the new option, which you would not select anyway, shifts your preference toward the expensive large {TV}. This simple example shows how the introduction of an irrelevant option, called the '' decoy,'' to the choice set can change preference between existing options, a phenomenon often called the context-dependent preference reversal. A number of models have been proposed to explain context effects. Despite their success, they are either uninformative about the underlying neural mechanisms or they require comparison of every possible pair of option attributes, a computation that is unlikely to be implemented by the nervous system due to its high computational demand and undesirable outcomes when the choice set size increases. Here we present a novel account of the context-dependent preference based on the adjustment of neural response to the set of available options. Moreover, we show results from a novel behavioral task designed to test contrasting predictions of our model and a classic model of context effects.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers state-dependent dynamics that mediate perception in the brain. In particular, it considers the formal basis of self-organized instabilities that enable perceptual transitions during Bayes-optimal perception. The basic phenomena we consider are perceptual transitions that lead to conscious ignition (Dehaene and Changeux, 2011) and how they depend on dynamical instabilities that underlie chaotic itinerancy (Breakspear, 2001; Tsuda, 2001) and self-organized criticality (Beggs and Plenz, 2003; Plenz and Thiagarajan, 2007; Shew et al., 2011). Our approach is based on a dynamical formulation of perception as approximate Bayesian inference, in terms of variational free energy minimization. This formulation suggests that perception has an inherent tendency to induce dynamical instabilities (critical slowing) that enable the brain to respond sensitively to sensory perturbations. We briefly review the dynamics of perception, in terms of generalized Bayesian filtering and free energy minimization, present a formal conjecture about self-organized instability and then test this conjecture, using neuronal (numerical) simulations of perceptual categorization.},

@article{Olshausen93,
	Abstract = {We present a biologically plausible model of an attentional mechanism for forming position- and scale-invariant representations of objects in the visual world. The model relies on a set of control neurons to dynamically modify the synaptic strengths of intracortical connections so that information from a windowed region of primary visual cortex (V1) is selectively routed to higher cortical areas. Local spatial relationships (i.e., topography) within the attentional window are preserved as information is routed through the cortex. This enables attended objects to be represented in higher cortical areas within an object-centered reference frame that is position and scale invariant. We hypothesize that the pulvinar may provide the control signals for routing information through the cortex. The dynamics of the control neurons are governed by simple differential equations that could be realized by neurobiologically plausible circuits. In preattentive mode, the control neurons receive their input from a low-level '' saliency map'' representing potentially interesting regions of a scene. During the pattern recognition phase, control neurons are driven by the interaction between top-down (memory) and bottom-up (retinal input) sources. The model respects key neurophysiological, neuroanatomical, and psychophysical data relating to attention, and it makes a variety of experimentally testable predictions.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters.

From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations.

@article{Mineault12,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the medial superior temporal ({MST}) area of the primate visual cortex respond selectively to complex motion patterns defined by expansion, rotation, and deformation. Consequently they are often hypothesized to be involved in important behavioral functions, such as encoding the velocities of moving objects and surfaces relative to the observer. However, the computations underlying such selectivity are unknown. In this work we have developed a unique, naturalistic motion stimulus and used it to probe the complex selectivity of {MST} neurons. The resulting data were then used to estimate the properties of the feed-forward inputs to each neuron. This analysis yielded models that successfully accounted for much of the observed stimulus selectivity, provided that the inputs were combined via a nonlinear integration mechanism that approximates a multiplicative interaction among {MST} inputs. In simulations we found that this type of integration has the functional role of improving estimates of the {3D} velocity of moving objects. As this computation is of general utility for detecting complex stimulus features, we suggest that it may represent a fundamental aspect of hierarchical sensory processing.},

	Abstract = {Photoreceptors strongly attenuate high temporal frequencies. Hence when an image moves, high spatial frequency components are lost if their direction of modulation coincides with the direction of movement, but not if it is orthogonal. The power spectra of natural images are remarkably consistent in having a 1/f 2 falloff in power in all directions. For moving images, the spatial power spectra will be distorted by becoming steeper in the direction corresponding to modulation in the direction of motion, and the contours of equal power will tend to become elliptical. This study demonstrates that the mammalian visual system is specifically sensitive to such anisotropic changes of the local power spectrum, and it is suggested that these distortions are used to determine patterns of optic flow. Convergent evidence from work on Glass figures, motion streaks, and sensitivity to {non-Cartesian} gratings is called on in support of this interpretation, which has been foreshadowed in several recent publications.},

Quantitative validation of this model, however, is difficult because the precise noise characteristics and prior expectations are unknown. Here, we present an augmented observer model that accounts for the variability of subjective responses in a speed discrimination task. This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

	Abstract = {Previous research has demonstrated learning in the pursuit system, but it is unclear whether these effects are the result of changes in visual or motor processing. The ability to maintain smooth pursuit during the transient disappearance of a visual target provides a way to assess pursuit properties in the absence of visual inputs. To study the long-term effects of learning on nonvisual signals for pursuit, we used an operant conditioning procedure. By providing a reinforcing auditory stimulus during periods of accurate tracking, we increased the pursuit velocity gain during target blanking from 0.59 in the baseline session to 0.89 after 8 to 10 daily sessions of training. Learning also reduced the occurrence of saccades. The learned effects generalized to untrained target velocities and persisted in the presence of a textured visual background. In a yoked-control group, the reinforcer was independent of the subjects' responses, and the velocity gain remained unchanged (from 0.6 to 0.63, respectively, before and after training). In a control group that received no reinforcer, gain increased slightly after repetition of the task (from 0.63 to 0.71, respectively, before and after training). Using a model of pursuit, we show that these effects of learning can be simulated by modifying the gain of an extra-retinal signal. Our results demonstrate that learned contingencies can increase eye velocity in the absence of visual signals and support the view that pursuit is regulated by extra-retinal signals that can undergo long-term plasticity.},

@article{Madelain11,
	Abstract = {Control of saccadic gain is often viewed as a simple compensatory process in which gain is adjusted over many trials by the postsaccadic retinal error, thereby maintaining saccadic accuracy. Here, we propose that gain might also be changed by a reinforcement process not requiring a visual error. To test this hypothesis, we used experimental paradigms in which retinal error was removed by extinguishing the target at the start of each saccade and either an auditory tone or the vision of the target on the fovea was provided as reinforcement after those saccades that met an amplitude criterion. These reinforcement procedures caused a progressive change in saccade amplitude in nearly all subjects, although the rate of adaptation differed greatly among subjects. When we reversed the contingencies and reinforced those saccades landing closer to the original target location, saccade gain changed back toward normal gain in most subjects. When subjects had saccades adapted first by reinforcement and a week later by conventional intrasaccadic step adaptation, both paradigms yielded similar degrees of gain changes and similar transfer to new amplitudes and to new starting positions of the target step as well as comparable rates of recovery. We interpret these changes in saccadic gain in the absence of postsaccadic retinal error as showing that saccade adaptation is not controlled by a single error signal. More generally, our findings suggest that normal saccade adaptation might involve general learning mechanisms rather than only specialized mechanisms for motor calibration.},

	Abstract = {Pursuit can be guided by perceived rather than physical motion, but the temporal relationship between motion perception and pursuit is unknown. We used an apparent motion stimulus consisting of a horizontal row of evenly spaced Kanizsa illusory squares (1.44 deg2): the illusory contours appeared at the midpoints of the illusory squares presented in the previous frame, producing bi-directional apparent motion of the illusory contours (21.5 deg/s) that could be reversed at will. We measured eye movements in five subjects asked to (1) track the motion of the illusory squares, and (2) reverse the perceived direction while continuing to track the squares. We measured the timing of the voluntary perceptual reversals and compared this to the time course of the reversal in tracking direction. We found that subjects could smoothly track the apparent motion of illusory squares and also produce saccade-free reversals in pursuit velocity. The time course of these motor reversals closely followed the measurements of the perceptual reversal and, on average, the perceptual reversals preceded the pursuit reversals by 53 ms, a delay shorter than when the perceptual reversal was visually guided. Smooth pursuit and the perception of motion direction were in temporal register and highly correlated, suggesting that pursuit can provide a real-time readout for the state of motion perception.},

	Abstract = {State-of-the-art coverage of Kalman filter methods for the design of neural networks This self-contained book consists of seven chapters by expert contributors that discuss Kalman filtering as applied to the training and use of neural networks. Although the traditional approach to the subject is almost always linear, this book recognizes and deals with the fact that real problems are most often nonlinear. <p> The first chapter offers an introductory treatment of Kalman filters with an emphasis on basic Kalman filter theory, {Rauch-Tung}-Striebel smoother, and the extended Kalman filter. Other chapters cover: <ul> <{li>An} algorithm for the training of feedforward and recurrent multilayered perceptrons, based on the decoupled extended Kalman filter ({DEKF}) <{li>Applications} of the {DEKF} learning algorithm to the study of image sequences and the dynamic reconstruction of chaotic processes <{li>The} dual estimation problem <{li>Stochastic} nonlinear dynamics: the expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithm and the extended Kalman smoothing ({EKS}) algorithm <{li>The} unscented Kalman filter </ul> <p> Each chapter, with the exception of the introduction, includes illustrative applications of the learning algorithms described here, some of which involve the use of simulated and real-life data. Kalman Filtering and Neural Networks serves as an expert resource for researchers in neural networks and nonlinear dynamical systems. An Instructor's Manual presenting detailed solutions to all the problems in the book is available upon request from the Wiley Makerting Department.},

@article{Assisi12,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the insect antennal lobe represent odors as spatiotemporal patterns of activity that unfold over multiple time scales. As these patterns unspool they decrease the overlap between odor representations and thereby increase the ability of the olfactory system to discriminate odors. Using a realistic model of the insect antennal lobe we examined two competing components of this process -lateral excitation from local excitatory interneurons, and slow inhibition from local inhibitory interneurons. We found that lateral excitation amplified differences between representations of similar odors by recruiting projection neurons that did not receive direct input from olfactory receptors. However, this increased sensitivity also amplified noisy variations in input and compromised the ability of the system to respond reliably to multiple presentations of the same odor. Slow inhibition curtailed the spread of projection neuron activity and increased response reliability. These competing influences must be finely balanced in order to decorrelate odor representations.},

@article{Carlson12,
	Abstract = {We have developed a sparse mathematical representation of speech that minimizes the number of active model neurons needed to represent typical speech sounds. The model learns several well-known acoustic features of speech such as harmonic stacks, formants, onsets and terminations, but we also find more exotic structures in the spectrogram representation of sound such as localized checkerboard patterns and frequency-modulated excitatory subregions flanked by suppressive sidebands. Moreover, several of these novel features resemble neuronal receptive fields reported in the Inferior Colliculus ({IC}), as well as auditory thalamus and cortex, and our model neurons exhibit the same tradeoff in spectrotemporal resolution as has been observed in {IC}. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that receptive fields of neurons in the ascending mammalian auditory pathway beyond the auditory nerve can be predicted based on coding principles and the statistical properties of recorded sounds. The receptive field of a neuron can be thought of as the stimulus that most strongly causes it to be active. Scientists have long been interested in discovering the underlying principles that determine the structure of receptive fields of cells in the auditory pathway to better understand how our brains process sound. One possible way of predicting these receptive fields is by using a theoretical model such as a sparse coding model. In such a model, each sound is represented by the smallest possible number of active model neurons chosen from a much larger group. A primary question addressed in this study is whether the receptive fields of model neurons optimized for natural sounds will predict receptive fields of actual neurons. Here, we use a sparse coding model on speech data. We find that our model neurons do predict receptive fields of auditory neurons, specifically in the Inferior Colliculus (midbrain) as well as the thalamus and cortex. To our knowledge, this is the first time any theoretical model has been able to predict so many of the diverse receptive fields of the various cell-types in those areas.},

@article{Voges12,
	Abstract = {Most studies on the dynamics of recurrent cortical networks are either based on purely random wiring or neighborhood couplings. Neuronal cortical connectivity, however, shows a complex spatial pattern composed of local and remote patchy connections. We ask to what extent such geometric traits influence the '' idle'' dynamics of two-dimensional (2d) cortical network models composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire (iaf) neurons. In contrast to the typical 1 mm2 used in most studies, we employ an enlarged spatial set-up of 25 mm2 to provide for long-range connections. Our models range from purely random to distance-dependent connectivities including patchy projections, i.e., spatially clustered synapses. Analyzing the characteristic measures for synchronicity and regularity in neuronal spiking, we explore and compare the phase spaces and activity patterns of our simulation results. Depending on the input parameters, different dynamical states appear, similar to the known synchronous regular '' {SR}'' or asynchronous irregular '' {AI}'' firing in random networks. Our structured networks, however, exhibit shifted and sharper transitions, as well as more complex activity patterns. Distance-dependent connectivity structures induce a spatio-temporal spread of activity, e.g., propagating waves, that random networks cannot account for. Spatially and temporally restricted activity injections reveal that a high amount of local coupling induces rather unstable {AI} dynamics. We find that the amount of local versus long-range connections is an important parameter, whereas the structurally advantageous wiring cost optimization of patchy networks has little bearing on the phase space.},

@article{Blanc11,
	Abstract = {Introduced by Shannon as a '' rate of actual transmission,'' mutual information rate ({MIR}) is an extension of mutual information to a pair of dynamical processes. We show a delay-independence theorem, according to which {MIR} is not sensitive to a time shift between the two processes. Numerical studies of several benchmark situations confirm that this theoretical asymptotic property remains valid for realistic finite sequences. Estimations based on block entropies and a causal state machine algorithm perform better than an estimation based on a {Lempel-Ziv} compression algorithm provided that block length and maximum history length, respectively, can be chosen larger than the delay. {MIR} is thus a relevant index for measuring nonlinear correlations between two experimental or simulated sequences when the transmission delay (in input-output devices) or dephasing (in coupled systems) is variable or unknown.},

	Abstract = {The curse of dimensionality poses severe challenges to both technical and conceptual progress in neuroscience. In particular, it plagues our ability to acquire, process, and model high-dimensional data sets. Moreover, neural systems must cope with the challenge of processing data in high dimensions to learn and operate successfully within a complex world. We review recent mathematical advances that provide ways to combat dimensionality in specific situations. These advances shed light on two dual questions in neuroscience. First, how can we as neuroscientists rapidly acquire high-dimensional data from the brain and subsequently extract meaningful models from limited amounts of these data? And second, how do brains themselves process information in their intrinsically high-dimensional patterns of neural activity as well as learn meaningful, generalizable models of the external world from limited experience?},

@article{Perrinet12pred,
	Abstract = {In low-level sensory systems, it is still unclear how the noisy information collected locally by neurons may give rise to a coherent global percept. This is well demonstrated for the detection of motion in the aperture problem: as luminance of an elongated line is symmetrical along its axis, tangential velocity is ambiguous when measured locally. Here, we develop the hypothesis that motion-based predictive coding is sufficient to infer global motion. Our implementation is based on a context-dependent diffusion of a probabilistic representation of motion. We observe in simulations a progressive solution to the aperture problem similar to physio-logy and behavior. We demonstrate that this solution is the result of two underlying mechanisms. First, we demonstrate the formation of a tracking behavior favoring temporally coherent features independent of their texture. Second, we observe that incoherent features are explained away, while coherent information diffuses progressively to the global scale. Most previous models included ad hoc mechanisms such as end-stopped cells or a selection layer to track specific luminance-based features as necessary conditions to solve the aperture problem. Here, we have proved that motion-based predictive coding, as it is implemented in this functional model, is sufficient to solve the aperture problem. This solution may give insights into the role of prediction underlying a large class of sensory computations.},

	Abstract = {When the sinusoidal grating of a "Gabor pattern" is drifted, the apparent position of the pattern shifts in the direction of motion [De Valois, R. L., \& De Valois, K. K. (1991). Vernier acuity with stationary moving Gabors. Vision Research, 31, 1619-1626]. We investigated the underlying cause of this illusion by determining whether the effect is a consequence of the internal motion shifting the perceived position of the whole pattern, or a consequence of a shift in the perceived location of the centroid (centre of mass) of the Gabor envelope. While each of these two possible distortions can account for a perceived positional offset, they give different predictions for the apparent size of the stimulus. A simple shift in perceived position results in no change in apparent size, while a centroid shift will likely result in either a decrease or an increase in the pattern's apparent size, depending on whether the trailing or leading edge of the Gabor stimulus is most affected by motion. We examined whether there is a change in the apparent size of Gabor patterns containing a range of grating motion speeds. We found that the perceived size of the pattern increased in the presence of motion as a function of speed, and is thus consistent with a centroid-shift explanation. We verified that this size change is a consequence of an increase in contrast at the leading edge, since the leading edge appears elongated relative to the trailing edge. We furthermore showed that the apparent-position shifts due to motion can be negated by displacing the centroid in the opposite direction to the motion.},

	Abstract = {After adaptation of the visual system to motion of a pattern in a particular direction, a static pattern appears to move in the opposite direction-the motion aftereffect ({MAE}). It is thought that the {MAE} is not accompanied by a shift in perceived spatial position of the pattern being viewed, providing psychophysical evidence for a dissociation of the neural processing of motion and position that complements anatomical and physiological evidence of functional specialization in primate and human visual cortex. However, here we measure the perceived orientation of a static windmill pattern after adaptation to rotary motion and find a gradual shift in orientation in the direction of the illusory rotation, though at a rate much lower than the apparent rotation speed. The orientation shift, which started to decline within a few seconds, could persist longer than the {MAE}, and disappeared when the {MAE} was nulled by physical motion of the windmill pattern. Our results indicate that the representation of the position of spatial pattern is dynamically updated by neurons involved in the analysis of motion.},

@article{Brette12,
	Abstract = {Neurons communicate primarily with spikes, but most theories of neural computation are based on firing rates. Yet, many experimental observations suggest that the temporal coordination of spikes plays a role in sensory processing. Among potential spike-based codes, synchrony appears as a good candidate because neural firing and plasticity are sensitive to fine input correlations. However, it is unclear what role synchrony may play in neural computation, and what functional advantage it may provide. With a theoretical approach, I show that the computational interest of neural synchrony appears when neurons have heterogeneous properties. In this context, the relationship between stimuli and neural synchrony is captured by the concept of synchrony receptive field, the set of stimuli which induce synchronous responses in a group of neurons. In a heterogeneous neural population, it appears that synchrony patterns represent structure or sensory invariants in stimuli, which can then be detected by postsynaptic neurons. The required neural circuitry can spontaneously emerge with spike-timing-dependent plasticity. Using examples in different sensory modalities, I show that this allows simple neural circuits to extract relevant information from realistic sensory stimuli, for example to identify a fluctuating odor in the presence of distractors. This theory of synchrony-based computation shows that relative spike timing may indeed have computational relevance, and suggests new types of neural network models for sensory processing with appealing computational properties. How does the brain compute? Traditional theories of neural computation describe the operating function of neurons in terms of average firing rates, with the timing of spikes bearing little information. However, numerous studies have shown that spike timing can convey information and that neurons are highly sensitive to synchrony in their inputs. Here I propose a simple spike-based computational framework, based on the idea that stimulus-induced synchrony can be used to extract sensory invariants (for example, the location of a sound source), which is a difficult task for classical neural networks. It relies on the simple remark that a series of repeated coincidences is in itself an invariant. Many aspects of perception rely on extracting invariant features, such as the spatial location of a time-varying sound, the identity of an odor with fluctuating intensity, the pitch of a musical note. I demonstrate that simple synchrony-based neuron models can extract these useful features, by using spiking models in several sensory modalities.},

In this letter, we make the simple point that all current statistics used to make inferences about directed influences in functional neuroimage time series are variants of the same underlying quantity. This includes directed transfer entropy, transinformation, {Kullback-Leibler} formulations, conditional mutual information, and Granger causality. Crucially, in the case of autoregressive modeling, the underlying quantity is the likelihood ratio that compares models with and without directed influences from the past when modeling the influence of one time series on another. This framework is also used to derive the relation between these measures of directed influence and the complexity or the order of directed influence. These results provide a framework for unifying the {Kullback-Leibler} divergence, Granger causality, and the complexity of directed influence.},

@article{Shriki12,
	Abstract = {Understanding how populations of neurons encode sensory information is a major goal of systems neuroscience. Attempts to answer this question have focused on responses measured over several hundred milliseconds, a duration much longer than that frequently used by animals to make decisions about the environment. How reliably sensory information is encoded on briefer time scales, and how best to extract this information, is unknown. Although it has been proposed that neuronal response latency provides a major cue for fast decisions in the visual system, this hypothesis has not been tested systematically and in a quantitative manner. Here we use a simple 'race to threshold' readout mechanism to quantify the information content of spike time latency of primary visual (V1) cortical cells to stimulus orientation. We find that many V1 cells show pronounced tuning of their spike latency to stimulus orientation and that almost as much information can be extracted from spike latencies as from firing rates measured over much longer durations. To extract this information, stimulus onset must be estimated accurately. We show that the responses of cells with weak tuning of spike latency can provide a reliable onset detector. We find that spike latency information can be pooled from a large neuronal population, provided that the decision threshold is scaled linearly with the population size, yielding a processing time of the order of a few tens of milliseconds. Our results provide a novel mechanism for extracting information from neuronal populations over the very brief time scales in which behavioral judgments must sometimes be made.},

	Abstract = {We present a new learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines that contain many layers of hidden variables. Data-dependent statistics are estimated using a variational approximation that tends to focus on a single mode, and data-independent statistics are estimated using persistent Markov chains. The use of two quite different techniques for estimating the two types of statistic that enter into the gradient of the log likelihood makes it practical to learn Boltzmann machines with multiple hidden layers and millions of parameters. The learning can be made more efficient by using a layer-by-layer pretraining phase that initializes the weights sensibly. The pretraining also allows the variational inference to be initialized sensibly with a single bottom-up pass. We present results on the {MNIST} and {NORB} data sets showing that deep Boltzmann machines learn very good generative models of handwritten digits and {3D} objects. We also show that the features discovered by deep Boltzmann machines are a very effective way to initialize the hidden layers of feedforward neural nets, which are then discriminatively fine-tuned.},

	Abstract = {Descending feedback connections, together with ascending feedforward ones, are the indispensable parts of the sensory pathways in the central nervous system. This study investigates the potential roles of feedback interactions in neural information processing. We consider a two-layer continuous attractor neural network ({CANN}), in which neurons in the first layer receive feedback inputs from those in the second one. By utilizing the intrinsic property of a {CANN}, we use a projection method to reduce the dimensionality of the network dynamics significantly. The simplified dynamics allows us to elucidate the effects of feedback modulation analytically. We find that positive feedback enhances the stability of the network state, leading to an improved population decoding performance, whereas negative feedback increases the mobility of the network state, inducing spontaneously moving bumps. For strong, negative feedback interaction, the network response to a moving stimulus can lead the actual stimulus position, achieving an anticipative behavior. The biological implications of these findings are discussed. The simulation results agree well with our theoretical analysis.},

@article{Yarrow12,
	Abstract = {The precision of the neural code is commonly investigated using two families of statistical measures: Shannon mutual information and derived quantities when investigating very small populations of neurons and Fisher information when studying large populations. These statistical tools are no longer the preserve of theorists and are being applied by experimental research groups in the analysis of empirical data. Although the relationship between information-theoretic and Fisher-based measures in the limit of infinite populations is relatively well understood, how these measures compare in finite-size populations has not yet been systematically explored. We aim to close this gap. We are particularly interested in understanding which stimuli are best encoded by a given neuron within a population and how this depends on the chosen measure. We use a novel Monte Carlo approach to compute a stimulus-specific decomposition of the mutual information (the {SSI}) for populations of up to 256 neurons and show that Fisher information can be used to accurately estimate both mutual information and {SSI} for populations of the order of 100 neurons, even in the presence of biologically realistic variability, noise correlations, and experimentally relevant integration times. According to both measures, the stimuli that are best encoded are those falling at the flanks of the neuron's tuning curve. In populations of fewer than around 50 neurons, however, Fisher information can be misleading.},

@article{Durant12a,
	Abstract = {Optic flow motion patterns can be a rich source of information about our own movement and about the structure of the environment we are moving in. We investigate the information available to the brain under real operating conditions by analyzing video sequences generated by physically moving a camera through various typical human environments. We consider to what extent the motion signal maps generated by a biologically plausible, two-dimensional array of correlation-based motion detectors ({2DMD}) not only depend on egomotion, but also reflect the spatial setup of such environments. We analyzed the local motion outputs by extracting the relative amounts of detected directions and comparing the spatial distribution of the motion signals to that of idealized optic flow. Using a simple template matching estimation technique, we are able to extract the focus of expansion and find relatively small errors that are distributed in characteristic patterns in different scenes. This shows that all types of scenes provide suitable motion information for extracting ego motion despite the substantial levels of noise affecting the motion signal distributions, attributed to the sparse nature of optic flow and the presence of camera jitter. However, there are large differences in the shape of the direction distributions between different types of scenes; in particular, man-made office scenes are heavily dominated by directions in the cardinal axes, which is much less apparent in outdoor forest scenes. Further examination of motion magnitudes at different scales and the location of motion information in a scene revealed different patterns across different scene categories. This suggests that self-motion patterns are not only relevant for deducing heading direction and speed but also provide a rich information source for scene structure and could be important for the rapid formation of the gist of a scene under normal human locomotion.},

@article{ORegan01,
	Abstract = {Many current neurophysiological, psychophysical, and psychological approaches to vision rest on the idea that when we see, the brain produces an internal representation of the world. The activation of this internal representation is assumed to give rise to the experience of seeing. The problem with this kind of approach is that it leaves unexplained how the existence of such a detailed internal representation might produce visual consciousness. An alternative proposal is made here. We propose that seeing is a way of acting. It is a particular way of exploring the environment. Activity in internal representations does not generate the experience of seeing. The outside world serves as its own, external, representation. The experience of seeing occurs when the organism masters what we call the governing laws of sensorimotor contingency. The advantage of this approach is that it provides a natural and principled way of accounting for visual consciousness, and for the differences in the perceived quality of sensory experience in the different sensory modalities. Several lines of empirical evidence are brought forward in support of the theory, in particular: evidence from experiments in sensorimotor adaptation, visual "filling in," visual stability despite eye movements, change blindness, sensory substitution, and color perception.},

@article{Schwartz08,
	Abstract = {Pattern recognition is one of the most important tasks of the visual system, and uncovering the neural mechanisms underlying recognition phenomena has been a focus of researchers for decades. Surprisingly, at the earliest stages of vision, the retina is capable of highly sophisticated temporal pattern recognition. We stimulated the retina of tiger salamander (Ambystoma tigrinum) with periodic dark flash sequences and found that retinal ganglion cells had a wide variety of different responses to a periodic flash sequence with many firing when a flash was omitted. The timing of the omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) depended on the period, with individual cells tracking the stimulus period down to increments of 5 ms. When flashes occurred earlier than expected, cells updated their expectation of the next flash time by as much as 50 ms. When flashes occurred later than expected, cells fired an {OSR} and reset their temporal expectation to the average time interval between flashes. Using pharmacology to investigate the retinal circuitry involved, we found that inhibitory transmission from amacrine cells was not required, but on bipolar cells were required. The results suggest a mechanism in which the intrinsic resonance of on bipolars leads to the {OSR} in ganglion cells. We discuss the implications of retinal pattern recognition on the neural code of the retina and visual processing in general.},

	Abstract = {Recent work has identified a neuron with widespread projections to odour processing regions of the honeybee brain whose activity represents the reward value of gustatory stimuli. We have constructed a model of bee foraging in uncertain environments based on this type of neuron and a predictive form of hebbian synaptic plasticity. The model uses visual input from a simulated three-dimensional world and accounts for a wide range of experiments on bee learning during foraging, including risk aversion. The predictive model shows how neuromodulatory influences can be used to bias actions and control synaptic plasticity in a way that goes beyond standard correlational mechanisms. Although several behavioural models of conditioning in bees have been proposed, this model is based on the neural substrate and was tested in a simulation of bee flight.},

@article{Kiebel08,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we suggest that cortical anatomy recapitulates the temporal hierarchy that is inherent in the dynamics of environmental states. Many aspects of brain function can be understood in terms of a hierarchy of temporal scales at which representations of the environment evolve. The lowest level of this hierarchy corresponds to fast fluctuations associated with sensory processing, whereas the highest levels encode slow contextual changes in the environment, under which faster representations unfold. First, we describe a mathematical model that exploits the temporal structure of fast sensory input to track the slower trajectories of their underlying causes. This model of sensory encoding or perceptual inference establishes a proof of concept that slowly changing neuronal states can encode the paths or trajectories of faster sensory states. We then review empirical evidence that suggests that a temporal hierarchy is recapitulated in the macroscopic organization of the cortex. This anatomic-temporal hierarchy provides a comprehensive framework for understanding cortical function: the specific time-scale that engages a cortical area can be inferred by its location along a rostro-caudal gradient, which reflects the anatomical distance from primary sensory areas. This is most evident in the prefrontal cortex, where complex functions can be explained as operations on representations of the environment that change slowly. The framework provides predictions about, and principled constraints on, cortical structure--function relationships, which can be tested by manipulating the time-scales of sensory input. Currently, there is no theory that explains how the large-scale organization of the human brain can be related to our environment. This is astonishing because neuroscientists generally assume that the brain represents events in our environment by decoding sensory input. Here, we propose that the brain models the entire environment as a collection of hierarchical, dynamical systems, where slower environmental changes provide the context for faster changes. We suggest that there is a simple mapping between this temporal hierarchy and the anatomical hierarchy of the brain. Our theory provides a framework for explaining a wide range of neuroscientific findings by a single principle.},

@article{Friston11,
	Abstract = {This article poses a controversial question: is optimal control theory useful for understanding motor behavior or is it a misdirection? This question is becoming acute as people start to conflate internal models in motor control and perception (Poeppel et al., 2008; Hickok et al., 2011). However, the forward models in motor control are not the generative models used in perceptual inference. This Perspective tries to highlight the differences between internal models in motor control and perception and asks whether optimal control is the right way to think about things. The issues considered here may have broader implications for optimal decision theory and Bayesian approaches to learning and behavior in general. Copyright {\\\\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Feldman95,
	Abstract = {A hypothesis about sensorimotor integration (the λ model) is described and applied to movement control and kinesthesia. The central idea is that the nervous system organizes positional frames of reference for the sensorimotor apparatus and produces active movements by shifting the frames in terms of spatial coordinates. Kinematic and electromyographic patterns are not programmed, but emerge from the dynamic interaction among the system s components, including external forces within the designated frame of reference. Motoneuronal threshold properties and proprioceptive inputs to motoneurons may be cardinal components of the physiological mechanism that produces positional frames of reference. The hypothesis that intentional movements are produced by shifting the frame of reference is extended to multi-muscle and multi-degrees-of-freedom systems with a solution of the redundancy problem that allows the control of a joint alone or in combination with other joints to produce any desired limb configuration and movement trajectory. The model also implies that for each motor behavior, the nervous system uses a strategy that minimizes the number of changeable control variables and keeps the parameters of these changes invariant. Examples are provided of simulated kinematic and electromyographic signals from single- and multi-joint arm movements produced by suggested patterns of control variables. Empirical support is provided and additional tests of the model are suggested. The model is contrasted with others based on the ideas of programming of motoneuronal activity, muscle forces, stiffness, or movement kinematics.},

@article{Bialek01,
	Abstract = {We define predictive information {Ipred(T}) as the mutual information between the past and the future of a time series. Three qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation times T: {Ipred(T}) can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a finite number of parameters, then {Ipred(T}) grows logarithmically with a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power-law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite parameter (or non-parametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning theory and the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Furthermore, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of {Ipred(T}) provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in problems in physics, statistics, and biology.},

@article{Mumford91,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes that each area of the cortex carries on its calculations with the active participation of a nucleus in the thalamus with which it is reciprocally and topographically connected. Each cortical area is responsible for maintaining and updating the organism's knowledge of a specific aspect of the world, ranging from low level raw data to high level abstract representations, and involving interpreting stimuli and generating actions. In doing this, it will draw on multiple sources of expertise, learned from experience, creating multiple, often conflicting, hypotheses which are integrated by the action of the thalamic neurons and then sent back to the standard input layer of the cortex. Thus this nucleus plays the role of an 'active blackboard' on which the current best reconstruction of some aspect of the world is always displayed. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A sequel to this paper will discuss the cortico-cortical loops and propose quite different computational roles for them.},

Here we present data suggesting this illusion is driven by modulations of apparent contrast. We observe position shifts at blurred stimulus regions without corresponding changes to internal structure, and find that low-contrast targets are more difficult to detect at the trailing, as opposed to leading, edges of movement. Motion induced position shifts are also shown to occur without conscious appreciation of motion direction. Our data suggests that motion can influence spatial coding via interactions that modulate apparent contrast, thereby changing the regions of the stimulus that are visible.},

	Abstract = {It is well known that moving stimuli can appear to move more slowly when contrast is reduced (P. Thompson, 1982). Here we address the question whether changes in stimulus contrast also affect smooth pursuit eye movements. Subjects were asked to smoothly track a moving Gabor patch. Targets varied in velocity (1, 8, and 15 deg/s), spatial frequency (0.1, 1, 4, and 8 c/deg), and contrast, ranging from just below individual thresholds to maximum contrast. Results show that smooth pursuit eye velocity gain rose significantly with increasing contrast. Below a contrast level of two to three times threshold, pursuit gain, acceleration, latency, and positional accuracy were severely impaired. Therefore, the smooth pursuit motor response shows the same kind of slowing at low contrast that was demonstrated in previous studies on perception.},

@article{Simoncini11,
	Abstract = {In order to analyze the characteristics of a rich dynamic visual environment, the visual system must integrate information collected at different scales through different spatiotemporal frequency channels. Still, it remains unclear how reliable representations of motion direction or speed are elaborated when presented with large bandwidth motion stimuli or natural statistics. Last year, we have shown that broadening the spatiotemporal frequency content of a textured pattern moving at constant speed leads to different results on a reflexive tracking task and a speed discrimination task. Larger bandwidth stimuli increase response amplitude and sensitivity of ocular following, consistently with a maximum-likelihood ({ML}) model of motion decoding. In contrast, larger bandwidth stimuli impair speed discrimination performance, suggesting that the perceptual system cannot take advantage of such additional, redundant information. Instead of {ML}, a gain control decoding mechanism can explain the drop in performance, suggesting that action and perception rely on different decoding mechanisms. To further investigate such task-dependant pooling of motion information, we measured pattern discrimination performance using these textured stimuli. Two noise patterns were presented sequentially for 250 ms on a {CRT} monitor (1280 × 1024 @ 100 Hz) and covered 47\$\\,^{\\circ}\$ of visual angle with identical properties (mean {SF}, bandwidth {SF}, speed) except for a randomized phase spectrum. A test pattern was then presented and subjects were asked to match it with one or the other reference stimulus ({ABX} task). At small bandwidth and optimal mean spatial frequency (0.3 cpd), subjects were able to discriminate the two patterns with high accuracy. Performance dropped to chance level as spatial frequency bandwidth increased. Increasing the mean spatial frequency decreased the overall performance. Again, these results suggest that perceptual performance is deteriorated in presence of larger information.},

@article{Li12,
	Abstract = {A fundamental feature of the mammalian neocortex is its columnar organization. In the visual cortex, functional columns consisting of neurons with similar orientation preferences have been characterized extensively, but how these columns are constructed during development remains unclear. The radial unit hypothesis posits that the ontogenetic columns formed by clonally related neurons migrating along the same radial glial fibre during corticogenesis provide the basis for functional columns in adult neocortex. However, a direct correspondence between the ontogenetic and functional columns has not been demonstrated. Here we show that, despite the lack of a discernible orientation map in mouse visual cortex, sister neurons in the same radial clone exhibit similar orientation preferences. Using a retroviral vector encoding green fluorescent protein to label radial clones of excitatory neurons, and in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to measure neuronal response properties, we found that sister neurons preferred similar orientations whereas nearby non-sister neurons showed no such relationship. Interestingly, disruption of gap junction coupling by viral expression of a dominant-negative mutant of Cx26 (also known as Gjb2) or by daily administration of a gap junction blocker, carbenoxolone, during the first postnatal week greatly diminished the functional similarity between sister neurons, suggesting that the maturation of ontogenetic into functional columns requires intercellular communication through gap junctions. Together with the recent finding of preferential excitatory connections among sister neurons, our results support the radial unit hypothesis and unify the ontogenetic and functional columns in the visual cortex.},

@article{Barnes08,
	Abstract = {Ocular pursuit movements allow moving objects to be tracked with a combination of smooth movements and saccades. The principal objective is to maintain smooth eye velocity close to object velocity, thus minimising retinal image motion and maintaining acuity. Saccadic movements serve to realign the image if it falls outside the fovea, the area of highest acuity. Pursuit movements are often portrayed as voluntary but their basis lies in processes that sense retinal motion and can induce eye movements without active participation. The factor distinguishing pursuit from such reflexive movements is the ability to select and track a single object when presented with multiple stimuli. The selective process requires attention, which appears to raise the gain for the selected object and/or suppress that associated with other stimuli, the resulting competition often reducing pursuit velocity. Although pursuit is essentially a feedback process, delays in motion processing create problems of stability and speed of response. This is countered by predictive processes, probably operating through internal efference copy (extra-retinal) mechanisms using short-term memory to store velocity and timing information from prior stimulation. In response to constant velocity motion, the initial response is visually driven, but extra-retinal mechanisms rapidly take over and sustain pursuit. The same extra-retinal mechanisms may also be responsible for generating anticipatory smooth pursuit movements when past experience creates expectancy of impending object motion. Similar, but more complex, processes appear to operate during periodic pursuit, where partial trajectory information is stored and released in anticipation of expected future motion, thus minimising phase errors associated with motion processing delays.},

	Abstract = {In the natural world, the brain must handle inherent delays in visual processing. This is a problem particularly during dynamic tasks. A possible solution to visuo-motor delays is prediction of a future state of the environment based on the current state and properties of the environment learned from experience. Prediction is well known to occur in both saccades and pursuit movements and is likely to depend on some kind of internal visual model as the basis for this prediction. However, most evidence comes from controlled laboratory studies using simple paradigms. In this study, we examine eye movements made in the context of demanding natural behavior, while playing squash. We show that prediction is a pervasive component of gaze behavior in this context. We show in addition that these predictive movements are extraordinarily precise and operate continuously in time across multiple trajectories and multiple movements. This suggests that prediction is based on complex dynamic visual models of the way that balls move, accumulated over extensive experience. Since eye, head, arm, and body movements all co-occur, it seems likely that a common internal model of predicted visual state is shared by different effectors to allow flexible coordination patterns. It is generally agreed that internal models are responsible for predicting future sensory state for control of body movements. The present work suggests that model-based prediction is likely to be a pervasive component in natural gaze control as well.},

It has been proposed that activity of this sort could be related to current or planned eye movements, but it might also provide a more generalized abstract representation of the spatial disposition of targets, even when they are not visible. We have recorded from monkey posterior parietal cortex while the animal viewed a visual stimulus that disappeared, and then, depending on experimental context, could be inferred to be either moving or stationary. During this temporary absence of the stimulus, about half of the neurons were found to be significantly more active on those trials in which the stimulus could be presumed to be moving rather than stationary. The activity was thus present in the absence of either sensory input or motor output, suggesting that it may indeed constitute a generalized representation of target motion.},

	Abstract = {Synthetic biology has advanced the design of standardized control devices that program cellular functions and metabolic activities in living organisms. Rational interconnection of these synthetic switches resulted in increasingly complex designer networks that execute input-triggered genetic instructions with precision, robustness and computational logic reminiscent of electronic circuits. Using trigger-controlled transcription factors, which independently control gene expression, and {RNA}-binding proteins that inhibit the translation of transcripts harbouring specific {RNA} target motifs, we have designed a set of synthetic transcription--translation control devices that could be rewired in a plug-and-play manner. Here we show that these combinatorial circuits integrated a two-molecule input and performed digital computations with {NOT}, {AND}, {NAND} and {N-IMPLY} expression logic in single mammalian cells. Functional interconnection of two {N-IMPLY} variants resulted in bitwise intracellular {XOR} operations, and a combinatorial arrangement of three logic gates enabled independent cells to perform programmable half-subtractor and half-adder calculations. Individual mammalian cells capable of executing basic molecular arithmetic functions isolated or coordinated to metabolic activities in a predictable, precise and robust manner may provide new treatment strategies and bio-electronic interfaces in future gene-based and cell-based therapies.},

@article{Churchland12,
	Abstract = {Most theories of motor cortex have assumed that neural activity represents movement parameters. This view derives from what is known about primary visual cortex, where neural activity represents patterns of light. Yet it is unclear how well the analogy between motor and visual cortex holds. Single-neuron responses in motor cortex are complex, and there is marked disagreement regarding which movement parameters are represented. A better analogy might be with other motor systems, where a common principle is rhythmic neural activity. Here we find that motor cortex responses during reaching contain a brief but strong oscillatory component, something quite unexpected for a non-periodic behaviour. Oscillation amplitude and phase followed naturally from the preparatory state, suggesting a mechanistic role for preparatory neural activity. These results demonstrate an unexpected yet surprisingly simple structure in the population response. This underlying structure explains many of the confusing features of individual neural responses.},

@article{Brown12,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we review the nature of illusions using the free-energy formulation of Bayesian perception. We reiterate the notion that illusory percepts are, in fact, Bayes-optimal and represent the most likely explanation for ambiguous sensory input. This point is illustrated using perhaps the simplest of visual illusions; namely, the Cornsweet effect. By using plausible prior beliefs about the spatial gradients of illuminance and reflectance in visual scenes, we show that the Cornsweet effect emerges as a natural consequence of Bayes-optimal perception. Furthermore, we were able to simulate the appearance of secondary illusory percepts (Mach bands) as a function of stimulus contrast. The contrast-dependent emergence of the Cornsweet effect and subsequent appearance of Mach bands were simulated using a simple but plausible generative model. Because our generative model was inverted using a neurobiologically plausible scheme, we could use the inversion as a simulation of neuronal processing and implicit inference. Finally, we were able to verify the qualitative and quantitative predictions of this Bayes-optimal simulation psychophysically, using stimuli presented briefly to normal subjects at different contrast levels, in the context of a fixed alternative forced choice paradigm.},

@article{Friston12,
	Abstract = {If perception corresponds to hypothesis testing (Gregory, 1980); then visual searches might be construed as experiments that generate sensory data. In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex ({MEC}) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the {MEC}, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

@article{Hedges11,
	Abstract = {
                The local spatiotemporal pattern of light on the retina is often consistent with a single translational velocity which may also be interpreted as a superposition of spatial patterns translating with different velocities. Human perception reflects such interpretations, as can be demonstrated using stimuli constructed from a superposition of two drifting gratings. Depending on a variety of parameters, these stimuli may be perceived as a coherently moving plaid pattern or as two transparent gratings moving in different directions. Here, we propose a quantitative model that explains how and why such interpretations are selected. An observer's percept corresponds to the most probable interpretation of noisy measurements of local image motion, based on separate prior beliefs about the speed and singularity of visual motion. This model accounts for human perceptual interpretations across a broad range of angles and speeds. With optimized parameters, its components are consistent with previous results in motion perception.

@article{Ernst12,
	Abstract = {For processing and segmenting visual scenes, the brain is required to combine a multitude of features and sensory channels. It is neither known if these complex tasks involve optimal integration of information, nor according to which objectives computations might be performed. Here, we investigate if optimal inference can explain contour integration in human subjects. We performed experiments where observers detected contours of curvilinearly aligned edge configurations embedded into randomly oriented distractors. The key feature of our framework is to use a generative process for creating the contours, for which it is possible to derive a class of ideal detection models. This allowed us to compare human detection for contours with different statistical properties to the corresponding ideal detection models for the same stimuli. We then subjected the detection models to realistic constraints and required them to reproduce human decisions for every stimulus as well as possible. By independently varying the four model parameters, we identify a single detection model which quantitatively captures all correlations of human decision behaviour for more than 2000 stimuli from 42 contour ensembles with greatly varying statistical properties. This model reveals specific interactions between edges closely matching independent findings from physiology and psychophysics. These interactions imply a statistics of contours for which edge stimuli are indeed optimally integrated by the visual system, with the objective of inferring the presence of contours in cluttered scenes. The recurrent algorithm of our model makes testable predictions about the temporal dynamics of neuronal populations engaged in contour integration, and it suggests a strong directionality of the underlying functional anatomy. Since Helmholtz put forward his concept that the brain performs inference on its sensory input for building an internal representation of the outside world, it is a puzzle for neuroscientific research whether visual perception can indeed be understood from first principles. An important part of vision is the integration of colinearly aligned edge elements into contours, which is required for the detection of object boundaries. We show that this visual function can fully be explained in a probabilistic model with a well--defined statistical objective. For this purpose, we developed a novel method to adapt models to correlations in human behaviour, and applied this technique to tightly link psychophysical experiments and numerical simulations of contour integration. The results not only demonstrate that complex neuronal computations can be elegantly described in terms of constrained probabilistic inference, but also reveal yet unknown neural mechanisms underlying early visual information processing.},

	Abstract = {Coordinated spiking activity in neuronal ensembles, in local networks and across multiple cortical areas, is thought to provide the neural basis for cognition and adaptive behavior. Examining such collective dynamics at the level of single neuron spikes has remained, however, a considerable challenge. We found that the spiking history of small and randomly sampled ensembles (approximately 20-200 neurons) could predict subsequent single neuron spiking with substantial accuracy in the sensorimotor cortex of humans and nonhuman behaving primates. Furthermore, spiking was better predicted by the ensemble's history than by the ensemble's instantaneous state (Ising models), emphasizing the role of temporal dynamics leading to spiking. Notably, spiking could be predicted not only by local ensemble spiking histories, but also by spiking histories in different cortical areas. These strong collective dynamics may provide a basis for understanding cognition and adaptive behavior at the level of coordinated spiking in cortical networks.},

We examined the dynamics of cortical eye-position signals in four dorsal visual areas of the macaque brain: the lateral and ventral intraparietal areas ({LIP}; {VIP}), the middle temporal area ({MT}), and the medial-superior temporal area ({MST}). We recorded extracellular activity of single neurons while the animal performed sequences of fixations and saccades in darkness. The data show that eye-position signals are updated predictively, such that the representation shifts in the direction of a saccade prior to (<100 ms) the actual eye movement. Despite this early start, eye-position signals remain inaccurate until shortly after (10150 ms) the eye movement. By using simulated behavioral experiments, we show that this brief misrepresentation of eye position provides a neural explanation for the psychophysical phenomenon of perisaccadic mislocalization, in which observers misperceive the positions of visual targets flashed around the time of saccadic eye movements. Together, these results suggest that eye-position signals in the dorsal visual system are updated rapidly across eye movements and play a direct role in perceptual localization, even when they are erroneous. º Eye position is encoded in the activity of neurons in the dorsal visual system º Eye-position signals are updated in advance of an impending eye movement º The updating process occurs more slowly than the actual change in eye position º The misrepresentation of eye position in parietal cortex explains a well-known illusion},

@article{Raikov12,
	Abstract = {We present a new approach to modeling languages for computational biology, which we call the layer-oriented approach. The approach stems from the observation that many diverse biological phenomena are described using a small set of mathematical formalisms (e.g. differential equations), while at the same time different domains and subdomains of computational biology require that models are structured according to the accepted terminology and classification of that domain. Our approach uses distinct semantic layers to represent the domain-specific biological concepts and the underlying mathematical formalisms. Additional functionality can be transparently added to the language by adding more layers. This approach is specifically concerned with declarative languages, and throughout the paper we note some of the limitations inherent to declarative approaches. The layer-oriented approach is a way to specify explicitly how high-level biological modeling concepts are mapped to a computational representation, while abstracting away details of particular programming languages and simulation environments. To illustrate this process, we define an example language for describing models of ionic currents, and use a general mathematical notation for semantic transformations to show how to generate model simulation code for various simulation environments. We use the example language to describe a Purkinje neuron model and demonstrate how the layer-oriented approach can be used for solving several practical issues of computational neuroscience model development. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the approach in comparison with other modeling language efforts in the domain of computational biology and outline some principles for extensible, flexible modeling language design. We conclude by describing in detail the semantic transformations defined for our language. The pursuit for understanding of neural function by computational modeling has produced a variety of software tools, with each tool targeting specific audiences and often requiring input in its own distinct language. Consequently, comprehending and communicating neuroscience models is a difficult and time-consuming task. In this paper we suggest a new approach towards designing biological modeling languages, which we call the layer-oriented approach. The approach stems from the observation that diverse biological phenomena are described using a small set of mathematical formalisms (e.g. differential equations), which are structured according to some biological principles. Our proposal is illustrated by means of a computer language for describing computational models of ionic currents. The language consists of rules for expressing mathematical equations as well as rules to organize these equations according to the specific terminology used by neuroscientists. The layer-oriented approach offers two chief advantages. First, it allows the flexible use of mathematical equations to represent many different kinds of biological models. Second, it restricts the language within a framework of biological concepts so that existing modeling software can be reused. The goal of the layer-oriented approach is to help define appropriate notations for computational biology while enabling interoperability of software for biological modeling.},

	Abstract = {Research progress in machine vision has been very significant in recent years. Robust face detection and identification algorithms are already readily available to consumers, and modern computer vision algorithms for generic object recognition are now coping with the richness and complexity of natural visual scenes. Unlike early vision models of object recognition that emphasized the role of figure-ground segmentation and spatial information between parts, recent successful approaches are based on the computation of loose collections of image features without prior segmentation or any explicit encoding of spatial relations. While these models remain simplistic models of visual processing, they suggest that, in principle, bottom-up activation of a loose collection of image features could support the rapid recognition of natural object categories and provide an initial coarse visual representation before more complex visual routines and attentional mechanisms take place. Focusing on biologically plausible computational models of (bottom-up) pre-attentive visual recognition, we review some of the key visual features that have been described in the literature. We discuss the consistency of these feature-based representations with classical theories from visual psychology and test their ability to account for human performance on a rapid object categorization task.},

	Abstract = {Primates are remarkably good at recognizing objects. The level of performance of their visual system and its robustness to image degradations still surpasses the best computer vision systems despite decades of engineering effort. In particular, the high accuracy of primates in ultra rapid object categorization and rapid serial visual presentation tasks is remarkable. Given the number of processing stages involved and typical neural latencies, such rapid visual processing is likely to be mostly feedforward. Here we show that a specific implementation of a class of feedforward theories of object recognition (that extend the Hubel and Wiesel simple-to-complex cell hierarchy and account for many anatomical and physiological constraints) can predict the level and the pattern of performance achieved by humans on a rapid masked animal vs. non-animal categorization task.},

@article{Rousselet03,
	Abstract = {Object categorization can be extremely fast. But among all objects, human faces might hold a special status that could depend on a specialized module. Visual processing could thus be faster for faces than for any other kind of object. Moreover, because face processing might rely on facial configuration, it could be more disrupted by stimulus inversion. Here we report two experiments that compared the rapid categorization of human faces and animals or animal faces in the context of upright and inverted natural scenes. In Experiment 1, the natural scenes contained human faces and animals in a full range of scales from close-up to far views. In Experiment 2, targets were restricted to close-ups of human faces and animal faces. Both experiments revealed the remarkable object processing efficiency of our visual system and further showed (1) virtually no advantage for faces over animals; (2) very little performance impairment with inversion; and (3) greater sensitivity of faces to inversion. These results are interpreted within the framework of a unique system for object processing in the ventral pathway. In this system, evidence would accumulate very quickly and efficiently to categorize visual objects, without involving a face module or a mental rotation mechanism. It is further suggested that rapid object categorization in natural scenes might not rely on high-level features but rather on features of intermediate complexity.},

	Abstract = {Amplitude spectra might provide information for natural scene classification. Amplitude does play a role in animal detection because accuracy suffers when amplitude is normalized. However, this effect could be due to an interaction between phase and amplitude, rather than to a loss of amplitude-only information. We used an amplitude-swapping paradigm to establish that animal detection is partly based on an interaction between phase and amplitude. A difference in false alarms for two subsets of our distractor stimuli suggests that the classification of scene environment (man-made versus natural) may also be based on an interaction between phase and amplitude. Examples of interaction between amplitude and phase are discussed.},

@article{Bosking97,
	Abstract = {Horizontal connections, formed primarily by the axon collaterals of pyramidal neurons in layer 2/3 of visual cortex, extend for millimeters parallel to the cortical surface and form patchy terminations. Previous studies have provided evidence that the patches formed by horizontal connections exhibit modular specificity, preferentially linking columns of neurons with similar response characteristics, such as preferred orientation. The issue of how these connections are distributed with respect to the topographic map of visual space, however, has not been resolved. Here we combine optical imaging of intrinsic signals with small extracellular injections of biocytin to assess quantitatively the specificity of horizontal connections with respect to both the map of orientation preference and the map of visual space in tree shrew V1. Our results indicate that horizontal connections outside a radius of 500 μm from the injection site exhibit not only modular specificity, but also specificity for axis of projection. Labeled axons extend for longer distances, and give off more terminal boutons, along an axis in the map of visual space that corresponds to the preferred orientation of the injection site. Inside of 500 μm, the pattern of connections is much less specific, with boutons found along every axis, contacting sites with a wide range of preferred orientations. The system of long-range horizontal connections can be summarized as preferentially linking neurons with co-oriented, co-axially aligned receptive fields. These observations suggest specific ways that horizontal circuits contribute to the response properties of layer 2/3 neurons and to mechanisms of visual perception.},

@article{Thorpe01,
	Abstract = {It is generally believed that the acuity of the peripheral visual field is too poor to allow accurate object recognition and, that to be identified, most objects need to be brought into foveal vision by using saccadic eye movements. However, most measures of form vision in the periphery have been done at eccentricities below 10 degrees and have used relatively artificial stimuli such as letters, digits and compound Gabor patterns. Little is known about how such data would apply in the case of more naturalistic stimuli. Here humans were required to categorize briefly flashed (28 ms) unmasked photographs of natural scenes (39 degrees high, and 26 degrees across) on the basis of whether or not they contained an animal. The photographs appeared randomly in nine locations across virtually the entire extent of the horizontal visual field. Accuracy was 93.3\% for central vision and decreased almost linearly with increasing eccentricity (89.8\% at 13 degrees, 76.1\% at 44.5 degrees and 71.2\% at 57.5 degrees ). Even at the most extreme eccentricity, where the images were centred at 70.5 degrees, subjects scored 60.5\% correct. No evidence was found for hemispheric specialization. This level of performance was achieved despite the fact that the position of the image was unpredictable, ruling out the use of precued attention to target locations. The results demonstrate that even high-level visual tasks involving object vision can be performed using the relatively coarse information provided by the peripheral retina.},

	Abstract = {Many morphogenetic processes involve mechanical rearrangements of epithelial tissues that are driven by precisely regulated cytoskeletal forces and cell adhesion. The mechanical state of the cell and intercellular adhesion are not only the targets of regulation, but are themselves the likely signals that coordinate developmental process. Yet, because it is difficult to directly measure mechanical stress in vivo on sub-cellular scale, little is understood about the role of mechanics in development. Here we present an alternative approach which takes advantage of the recent progress in live imaging of morphogenetic processes and uses computational analysis of high resolution images of epithelial tissues to infer relative magnitude of forces acting within and between cells. We model intracellular stress in terms of bulk pressure and interfacial tension, allowing these parameters to vary from cell to cell and from interface to interface. Assuming that epithelial cell layers are close to mechanical equilibrium, we use the observed geometry of the two dimensional cell array to infer interfacial tensions and intracellular pressures. Here we present the mathematical formulation of the proposed Mechanical Inverse method and apply it to the analysis of epithelial cell layers observed at the onset of ventral furrow formation in the Drosophila embryo and in the process of hair-cell determination in the avian cochlea. The analysis reveals mechanical anisotropy in the former process and mechanical heterogeneity, correlated with cell differentiation, in the latter process. The proposed method opens a way for quantitative and detailed experimental tests of models of cell and tissue mechanics. Mechanical forces play many important roles in cell biology and animal and plant development. In contrast to inanimate matter, forces in living matter are generated by active and highly regulated processes within and between cells. The ability to directly measure forces and mechanical stress on the cellular scale within living tissues is critically important for understanding many morphogenetic processes but is a serious experimental challenge. The present work proposes an alternative approach based on the analysis of images that provide a visualization of cell boundaries in two dimensional epithelial tissues. The method uses the assumption of force balance within the epithelial layer to infer, on the basis of image-derived geometric data, the mechanical state of each cell. The proposed Mechanical Inverse method is illustrated on the analysis of two examples: the initial step of the gastrulation process in the Drosophila embryo, and the process of neurogenesis in the developing avian cochlea.},

	Abstract = {Chromosomal crossover is a biological mechanism to combine parental traits. It is perhaps the first mechanism ever taught in any introductory biology class. The formulation of crossover, and resulting recombination, came about 100 years after Mendel's famous experiments. To a great extent, this formulation is consistent with the basic genetic findings of Mendel. More importantly, it provides a mathematical insight for his two laws (and corrects them). From a mathematical perspective, and while it retains similarities, genetic recombination guarantees diversity so that we do not rapidly converge to the same being. It is this diversity that made the study of biology possible. In particular, the problem of genetic mapping and linkage\^{a}one of the first efforts towards a computational approach to biology\^{a}relies heavily on the mathematical foundation of crossover and recombination. Nevertheless, as students we often overlook the mathematics of these phenomena. Emphasizing the mathematical aspect of Mendel's laws through crossover and recombination will prepare the students to make an early realization that biology, in addition to being experimental, {IS} a computational science. This can serve as a first step towards a broader curricular transformation in teaching biological sciences. I will show that a simple and modern treatment of Mendel's laws using a Markov chain will make this step possible, and it will only require basic college-level probability and calculus. My personal teaching experience confirms that students {WANT} to know Markov chains because they hear about them from bioinformaticists all the time. This entire exposition is based on three homework problems that I designed for a course in computational biology. A typical reader is, therefore, an instructional staff member or a student in a computational field (e.g., computer science, mathematics, statistics, computational biology, bioinformatics). However, other students may easily follow by omitting the mathematically more elaborate parts. I kept those as separate sections in the exposition.},

@article{Wester12,
	Abstract = {The cortex is organized in vertical and horizontal circuits that determine the spatiotemporal properties of distributed cortical activity. Despite detailed knowledge of synaptic interactions among individual cells in the neocortex, little is known about the rules governing interactions among local populations. Here, we used self-sustained recurrent activity generated in cortex, also known as up-states, in rat thalamocortical slices in vitro to understand interactions among laminar and horizontal circuits. By means of intracellular recordings and fast optical imaging with voltage-sensitive dyes, we show that single thalamic inputs activate the cortical column in a preferential layer 4 (L4) → layer 2/3 (L2/3) → layer 5 (L5) sequence, followed by horizontal propagation with a leading front in supragranular and infragranular layers. To understand the laminar and columnar interactions, we used focal injections of {TTX} to block activity in small local populations, while preserving functional connectivity in the rest of the network. We show that L2/3 alone, without underlying L5, does not generate self-sustained activity and is inefficient propagating activity horizontally. In contrast, L5 sustains activity in the absence of L2/3 and is necessary and sufficient to propagate activity horizontally. However, loss of L2/3 delays horizontal propagation via L5. Finally, L5 amplifies activity in L2/3. Our results show for the first time that columnar interactions between supragranular and infragranular layers are required for the normal propagation of activity in the neocortex. Our data suggest that supragranular and infragranular circuits, with their specific and complex set of inputs and outputs, work in tandem to determine the patterns of cortical activation observed in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Discovering the structure inherent in a set of patterns is a fundamental aim of statistical inference or learning. One fruitful approach is to build a parameterized stochastic generative model, independent draws from which are likely to produce the patterns. For all but the simplest generative models, each pattern can be generated in exponentially many ways. It is thus intractable to adjust the parameters to maximize the probability of the observed patterns. We describe a way of finessing this combinatorial explosion by maximizing an easily computed lower bound on the probability of the observations. Our method can be viewed as a form of hierarchical self-supervised learning that may relate to the function of bottom-up and top-down cortical processing pathways.},

@article{Mumford92,
	Abstract = {This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a 'higher' area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.},

@article{Cortes11,
	Abstract = {Most neurons in the primary visual cortex initially respond vigorously when a preferred stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level, adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of the findings and relate it to published experimental data.},

	Abstract = {An object moving in discrete steps can appear to move continuously even along sections of the path in which no stimulus is presented. We investigated whether the internal representation of such an object is constructed by extrapolation, along the expected trajectory of the object, or by interpolation, after the subsequent reappearance of the object. Observers viewed two discs moving in an unambiguous apparent motion display, which either occasionally reversed direction or continued moving along the predicted path. Observers carried out a speeded {2AFC} task on probes presented between the possible disc locations. In the continuous condition, observers' reaction times to detect and identify a probe were longer when it occurred ahead of the disc than when it occurred elsewhere on the motion path. Conversely, when the disc reversed direction, significantly less interference was observed ahead of the disc (along the predicted motion path), and significantly more interference was observed behind the disc (along the updated motion path). We conclude that the representation of a moving object in an apparent motion display is constructed by interpolation as well as extrapolation. We demonstrate that this representation is maintained and updated even outside the locus of focused attention, and that it is possible to dissociate the contributions of interpolation and extrapolation mechanisms to an object's representation.},

	Comment = {* "Processing delay in the neural pathway on the order of tens of milliseconds should cause a significant offset between the perceived and the actual positions of a moving object. An appealing hypothesis is that the visual system can compensate for the neural delay and reduce the perceptual misalignment by extrapolating the trajectory of the moving object (Nijhawan, 1994, 1997). Evidence for motion extrapolation originally came from the flash-lag illusion in which the position of a moving object is perceived to be ahead of a briefly flashed object when they are physically colocalized at the time of the flash (MacKay, 1958; Nijhawan, 1994, 1997)." * "A neuronal model for the perceptual extrapolation What is the mechanism underlying the blur-dependent perceptual extrapolation? In a visuotopically organized neuronal circuit, the spatial profile of the population neural response moves within the circuit when the target moves in the visual field, and the position of the response profile may determine the perceived position of the visual target. In the rabbit and salamander retina, the transient response property and the contrast-gain control mechanism have been shown to shift the response profile of the retinal ganglion cells in the direction of target motion, which has been proposed as a mechanism for motion extrapolation (Berry et al., 1999). To test whether these retinal response properties can account for the blur-dependent perceptual extrapolation observed in this study, we simulated the response of each neuron to the motion-stop stimuli using these response properties and predicted the spatial profile of the population response of an array of neurons (see Materials and Methods). Surprisingly, we found that a simple model incorporating only the biphasic temporal response property (Fig. 3A) is sufficient to account for the spatiotemporal characteristics of the observed perceptual extrapolation." * a simple second-order motion: "The contrast-defined stimulus was a stationary sinusoidal grating at a high spatial frequency, with its contrast modulated by a moving Gaussian envelope (Fig. 4A)."},

@article{Remme12,
	Abstract = {Neurons adjust their intrinsic excitability when experiencing a persistent change in synaptic drive. This process can prevent neural activity from moving into either a quiescent state or a saturated state in the face of ongoing plasticity, and is thought to promote stability of the network in which neurons reside. However, most neurons are embedded in recurrent networks, which require a delicate balance between excitation and inhibition to maintain network stability. This balance could be disrupted when neurons independently adjust their intrinsic excitability. Here, we study the functioning of activity-dependent homeostatic scaling of intrinsic excitability ({HSE}) in a recurrent neural network. Using both simulations of a recurrent network consisting of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that implement {HSE}, and a mean-field description of adapting excitatory and inhibitory populations, we show that the stability of such adapting networks critically depends on the relationship between the adaptation time scales of both neuron populations. In a stable adapting network, {HSE} can keep all neurons functioning within their dynamic range, while the network is undergoing several (patho)physiologically relevant types of plasticity, such as persistent changes in external drive, changes in connection strengths, or the loss of inhibitory cells from the network. However, {HSE} cannot prevent the unstable network dynamics that result when, due to such plasticity, recurrent excitation in the network becomes too strong compared to feedback inhibition. This suggests that keeping a neural network in a stable and functional state requires the coordination of distinct homeostatic mechanisms that operate not only by adjusting neural excitability, but also by controlling network connectivity.},

	Abstract = {Cue-triggered recall of learned temporal sequences is an important cognitive function that has been attributed to higher brain areas. Here recordings in both anesthetized and awake rats demonstrate that after repeated stimulation with a moving spot that evoked sequential firing of an ensemble of primary visual cortex (V1) neurons, just a brief flash at the starting point of the motion path was sufficient to evoke a sequential firing pattern that reproduced the activation order evoked by the moving spot. The speed of recalled spike sequences may reflect the internal dynamics of the network rather than the motion speed. In awake rats, such recall was observed during a synchronized ('quiet wakeful') brain state having large-amplitude, low-frequency local field potential ({LFP}) but not in a desynchronized ('active') state having low-amplitude, high-frequency {LFP}. Such conditioning-enhanced, cue-evoked sequential spiking of a V1 ensemble may contribute to experience-based perceptual inference in a brain state-dependent manner.},

@article{Hass12,
	Abstract = {A prominent finding in psychophysical experiments on time perception is Weber's law, the linear scaling of timing errors with duration. The ability to reproduce this scaling has been taken as a criterion for the validity of neurocomputational models of time perception. However, the origin of Weber's law remains unknown, and currently only a few models generi- cally reproduce it. Here, we use an information-theoretical framework that considers the neuronal mechanisms of time perception as stochastic processes to investigate the statistical origin of Weber's law in time perception and also its frequently observed deviations. Under the assumption that the brain is able to compute optimal estimates of time, we find that Weber's law only holds exactly if the estimate is based on temporal changes in the variance of the process. In contrast, the timing errors scale sublinearly with time if the systematic changes in the mean of a process are used for estimation, as is the case in the majority of time perception models, while estimates based on temporal correlations result in a superlinear scaling. This hierarchy of temporal information is preserved if several sources of temporal information are available. Furthermore, we consider the case of multiple stochastic processes and study the examples of a covariance-based model and a model based on synfire chains. This approach reveals that existing neurocomputational models of time perception can be classified as mean-, variance- and correlation-based processes and allows predictions about the scaling of the resulting timing errors.},

@article{Friston09c,
	Abstract = {This paper questions the need for reinforcement learning or control theory when optimising behaviour. We show that it is fairly simple to teach an agent complicated and adaptive behaviours using a free-energy formulation of perception. In this formulation, agents adjust their internal states and sampling of the environment to minimize their free-energy. Such agents learn causal structure in the environment and sample it in an adaptive and self-supervised fashion. This results in behavioural policies that reproduce those optimised by reinforcement learning and dynamic programming. Critically, we do not need to invoke the notion of reward, value or utility. We illustrate these points by solving a benchmark problem in dynamic programming; namely the mountain-car problem, using active perception or inference under the free-energy principle. The ensuing proof-of-concept may be important because the free-energy formulation furnishes a unified account of both action and perception and may speak to a reappraisal of the role of dopamine in the brain.},

@article{Makin11,
	Abstract = {People are able to judge the current position of occluded moving objects. This operation is known as motion extrapolation. It has previously been suggested that motion extrapolation is independent of the oculomotor system. Here we revisited this question by measuring eye position while participants completed two types of motion extrapolation task. In one task, a moving visual target travelled rightwards, disappeared, then reappeared further along its trajectory. Participants discriminated correct reappearance times from incorrect (too early or too late) with a two-alternative forced-choice button press. In the second task, the target travelled rightwards behind a visible, rectangular occluder, and participants pressed a button at the time when they judged it should reappear. In both tasks, performance was significantly different under fixation as compared to free eye movement conditions. When eye movements were permitted, eye movements during occlusion were related to participants' judgements. Finally, even when participants were required to fixate, small changes in eye position around fixation (<2\\$\\\\,^{\\\\circ}\\$) were influenced by occluded target motion. These results all indicate that overlapping systems control eye movements and judgements on motion extrapolation tasks. This has implications for understanding the mechanism underlying motion extrapolation. {\\\\copyright} 2011 The Experimental Psychology Society},

	Abstract = {Primates can learn to recognize a virtually limitless number of visual objects. A candidate neural substrate for this adult plasticity is the inferior temporal cortex ({ITC}). Using a large stimulus set, we explored the impact that long-term experience has on the response properties of two classes of neurons in {ITC}: broad-spiking (putative excitatory) cells and narrow-spiking (putative inhibitory) cells. We found that experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory neurons but had the opposite effect on maximum responses of putative inhibitory neurons, an observation that helps to reconcile contradictory reports regarding the presence and direction of this effect. In addition, we found that experience reduced the average stimulus-evoked response in both cell classes, but this decrease was much more pronounced in putative inhibitory units. This latter finding supports a potentially critical role of inhibitory neurons in detecting and initiating the cascade of events underlying adult neural plasticity in {ITC}. \^{a}º We explored effects of long-term experience on distinct cell classes in {IT} cortex \^{a}º Experience increased maximum responses of putative excitatory cells \^{a}º Experience decreased maximum responses of putative inhibitory cells \^{a}º Experience decreased average responses of both cell classes but more so in inhibitory},

	Abstract = {Thalamic gating of sensory inputs to the cortex varies with behavioral conditions, such as sleep--wake cycles, or with different stages of anesthesia. Behavioral conditions in turn are accompanied by stereotypic spectral content of the {EEG}. In the rodent somatosensory system, the receptive field size of the ventral posteromedial thalamic nucleus ({VPM}) shrinks when anesthesia is deepened. Here we examined whether evoked thalamic responses are correlated with global {EEG} activity on a fine time scale of a few seconds. Trial-by-trial analysis of responses of {VPM} cells to whisker stimulation in lightly anesthetized rats indicated that increased {EEG} power in the delta band (1--4 Hz) was accompanied by a small, but highly significant, reduction in spontaneous and evoked thalamic firing. The opposite effect was found for the gamma {EEG} band (30--50 Hz). These significant correlations were not accompanied by an apparent change in the size of the receptive fields and were not {EEG} phase-related. The correlation between {EEG} and firing rate was observed only in neurons that responded to multiple whiskers and was higher for the non-principal whiskers. Importantly, the contributions of the two {EEG} bands to the modulation of {VPM} responses were to a large extent independent of each other. Our findings suggest that information conveyed by different whiskers can be rapidly modulated according to the global brain activity.},

	Abstract = {In most of the in vivo electrophysiological studies of cortical processing, which are extracellular, the spike-triggered local field potential average ({LFP} {STA}) is the measure used to estimate the correlation between the synaptic inputs of individual neuron and the local population. To understand how the magnitude and shape of {LFP} {STA} reflect the underlying correlation of synaptic activities, the membrane potential of the firing neuron has to be recorded together with the {LFP}. Using intracellular recordings from the cortex of awake rats, we found that for a large range of firing rates and for different behavioral states, the {LFP} {STA} represents both in its waveform and its magnitude the cross-correlation between the membrane potential of the neuron and the {LFP}. This data, supported by further analysis, suggests that {LFP} {STA} does not represent large network events specific to the spike times, but rather the synchrony between the mean synaptic activity of the population and the membrane potential of the single neuron, present both around spike times and in the intervals between spikes. Furthermore, it introduces a novel interpretation of the available data from unit and {LFP} extracellular recording experiments.},

@article{Loreto12,
	Abstract = {One of the fundamental problems in cognitive science is how humans categorize the visible color spectrum. The empirical evidence of the existence of universal or recurrent patterns in color naming across cultures is paralleled by the observation that color names begin to be used by individual cultures in a relatively fixed order. The origin of this hierarchy is largely unexplained. Here we resort to multiagent simulations, where a population of individuals, subject to a simple perceptual constraint shared by all humans, namely the human Just Noticeable Difference, categorizes and names colors through a purely cultural negotiation in the form of language games. We found that the time needed for a population to reach consensus on a color name depends on the region of the visible color spectrum. If color spectrum regions are ranked according to this criterion, a hierarchy with [red, (magenta)-red], [violet], [green/yellow], [blue], [orange], and [cyan], appearing in this order, is recovered, featuring an excellent quantitative agreement with the empirical observations of the {WCS}. Our results demonstrate a clear possible route to the emergence of hierarchical color categories, confirming that the theoretical modeling in this area has now attained the required maturity to make significant contributions to the ongoing debates concerning language universals.},

@article{Quaia12,
	Abstract = {Ocular following responses ({OFRs}) are tracking eye movements elicited at ultrashort latency by the sudden movement of a textured pattern. Here we report the results of our study of their dependency on the spatial arrangement of the motion stimulus. Unlike previous studies that looked at the effect of stimulus size, we investigated the impact of stimulus location and how two distinct stimuli, presented together, collectively determine the {OFR}. We used as stimuli vertical gratings that moved in the horizontal direction and that were confined to either one or two 0.58\$\\,^{\\circ}\$ high strips, spanning the width of the screen. We found that the response to individual strips varied as a function of the location and spatial frequency ({SF}) of the stimulus. The response decreased as the stimulus eccentricity increased, but this relationship was more accentuated at high than at low spatial frequencies. We also found that when pairs of stimuli were presented, nearby stimuli interacted strongly, so that the response to the pair was barely larger than the response to a single strip in the pair. This suppressive effect faded away as the separation between the strips increased. The variation of the suppressive interaction with strip separation, paired with the dependency on eccentricity of the responses to single strips, caused the peak response for strip pairs to be achieved at a specific separation, which varied as a function of {SF}.},

@article{Christopoulos09,
	Abstract = {Due to noisy motor commands and imprecise and ambiguous sensory information, there is often substantial uncertainty about the relative location between our body and objects in the environment. Little is known about how well people manage and compensate for this uncertainty in purposive movement tasks like grasping. Grasping objects requires reach trajectories to generate object-fingers contacts that permit stable lifting. For objects with position uncertainty, some trajectories are more efficient than others in terms of the probability of producing stable grasps. We hypothesize that people attempt to generate efficient grasp trajectories that produce stable grasps at first contact without requiring post-contact adjustments. We tested this hypothesis by comparing human uncertainty compensation in grasping objects against optimal predictions. Participants grasped and lifted a cylindrical object with position uncertainty, introduced by moving the cylinder with a robotic arm over a sequence of 5 positions sampled from a strongly oriented {2D} Gaussian distribution. Preceding each reach, vision of the object was removed for the remainder of the trial and the cylinder was moved one additional time. In accord with optimal predictions, we found that people compensate by aligning the approach direction with covariance angle to maintain grasp efficiency. This compensation results in higher probability to achieve stable grasps at first contact than non-compensation strategies in grasping objects with directional position uncertainty, and the results provide the first demonstration that humans compensate for uncertainty in a complex purposive task. Optimal sensorimotor control models actions as decisions that maximize the desirableness of outcomes, where the desirableness is captured by an expected cost or utility to each action sequence. These models provide explanations for many aspects of our ability to compensate for uncertainty, but they have not been applied to understanding purposive movements---movements involving the application of forces to change the relative position of objects and the actor in the environment. Using time efficiency as a natural cost function, we present a statistical optimal control analysis of uncertainty compensation strategies in a purposive movement task, grasping an object with directional position uncertainty. In accord with the predictions of the analysis, the experimental results showed that people compensate for uncertainty by adopting grasp strategies that increase the chance to produce a stable grasp at first contact. Our findings suggest that visuomotor system plans for uncertainty even in complex purposive movements.},

@article{Christopoulos11,
	Abstract = {As we move, the relative location between our hands and objects changes in uncertain ways due to noisy motor commands and imprecise and ambiguous sensory information. The impressive capabilities humans display for interacting and manipulating objects with position uncertainty suggest that our brain maintains representations of location uncertainty and builds compensation for uncertainty into its motor control strategies. Our previous work demonstrated that specific control strategies are used to compensate for location uncertainty. However, it is an open question whether compensation for position uncertainty in grasping is consistent with the stochastic optimal feedback control, mainly due to the difficulty of modeling natural tasks within this framework. In this study, we develop a stochastic optimal feedback control model to evaluate the optimality of human grasping strategies. We investigate the properties of the model through a series of simulation experiments and show that it explains key aspects of previously observed compensation strategies. It also provides a basis for individual differences in terms of differential control costs?the controller compensates only to the extent that performance benefits in terms of making stable grasps outweigh the additional control costs of compensation. These results suggest that stochastic optimal feedback control can be used to understand uncertainty compensation in complex natural tasks like grasping.},

@article{Gerwinn11,
	Abstract = {Reconstructing stimuli from the spike trains of neurons is an important approach for understanding the neural code. One of the difficulties associated with this task is that signals which are varying continuously in time are encoded into sequences of discrete events or spikes. An important problem is to determine how much information about the continuously varying stimulus can be extracted from the time-points at which spikes were observed, especially if these time-points are subject to some sort of randomness. For the special case of spike trains generated by leaky integrate and fire neurons, noise can be introduced by allowing variations in the threshold every time a spike is released. A simple decoding algorithm previously derived for the noiseless case can be extended to the stochastic case, but turns out to be biased. Here, we review a solution to this problem, by presenting a simple yet efficient algorithm which greatly reduces the bias, and therefore leads to better decoding performance in the stochastic case.},

@article{Fougnie11,
	Abstract = {The world is composed of features and objects and this structure may influence what is stored in working memory. It is widely believed that the content of memory is object-based: Memory stores integrated objects, not independent features. We asked participants to report the color and orientation of an object and found that memory errors were largely independent: Even when one of the object's features was entirely forgotten, the other feature was often reported. This finding contradicts object-based models and challenges fundamental assumptions about the organization of information in working memory. We propose an alternative framework involving independent self-sustaining representations that may fail probabilistically and independently for each feature. This account predicts that the degree of independence in feature storage is determined by the degree of overlap in neural coding during perception. Consistent with this prediction, we found that errors for jointly encoded dimensions were less independent than errors for independently encoded dimensions.},

@article{Clemens11,
	Abstract = {Optimal coding principles are implemented in many large sensory systems. They include the systematic transformation of external stimuli into a sparse and decorrelated neuronal representation, enabling a flexible readout of stimulus properties. Are these principles also applicable to size-constrained systems, which have to rely on a limited number of neurons and may only have to fulfill specific and restricted tasks? We studied this question in an insect system---the early auditory pathway of grasshoppers. Grasshoppers use genetically fixed songs to recognize mates. The first steps of neural processing of songs take place in a small three-layer feed-forward network comprising only a few dozen neurons. We analyzed the transformation of the neural code within this network. Indeed, grasshoppers create a decorrelated and sparse representation, in accordance with optimal coding theory. Whereas the neuronal input layer is best read out as a summed population, a labeled-line population code for temporal features of the song is established after only two processing steps. At this stage, information about song identity is maximal for a population decoder that preserves neuronal identity. We conclude that optimal coding principles do apply to the early auditory system of the grasshopper, despite its size constraints. The inputs, however, are not encoded in a systematic, map-like fashion as in many larger sensory systems. Already at its periphery, part of the grasshopper auditory system seems to focus on behaviorally relevant features, and is in this property more reminiscent of higher sensory areas in vertebrates.},

	Abstract = {We present a framework for finding point correspondences in monocular image sequences over multiple frames. The general problem of multiframe point correspondence is {NP} hard for three or more frames. A polynomial time algorithm for a restriction of this problem is presented, and is used as the basis of proposed greedy algorithm for the general problem. The greedy nature of the proposed algorithm allows it to be used in real time systems for tracking and surveillance etc. In addition, the proposed algorithm deals with the problems of occlusion, missed detections, and false positives, by using a single noniterative greedy optimization scheme, and hence, reduces the complexity of the overall algorithm as compared to most existing approaches, where multiple heuristics are used for the same purpose. While most greedy algorithms for point tracking do not allow for entry and exit of points from the scene, this is not a limitation for the proposed algorithm. Experiments with real and synthetic data show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing techniques and is applicable in more general settings.},

Cortico-cortical pathways formed parallel sheets of interwoven paths in the longitudinal and medio-lateral axes, in which major pathways were local condensations. Cross-species homology was strong and showed emergence of complex gyral connectivity by continuous elaboration of this grid structure.

	Abstract = {This paper studies the properties of L1-analysis regularization for the resolution of linear inverse problems. Most previous works consider sparse synthesis priors where the sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal in a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary. The corresponding variational problem includes several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused lasso. We give a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the analysis regularization when there is no noise in the observations. The same criterion ensures the robustness of the sparse analysis solution to a small noise in the observations. We also define a stronger sufficient condition that ensures robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise. In the special case of synthesis regularization, our contributions recover already known results, that are hence generalized to the analysis setting. We illustrate these theoritical results on practical examples to study the robustness of the total variation and the fused lasso regularizations.},

@article{Ladenbauer12,
	Abstract = {The ability of spiking neurons to synchronize their activity in a network depends on the response behavior of these neurons as quantified by the phase response curve ({PRC}) and on coupling properties. The {PRC} characterizes the effects of transient inputs on spike timing and can be measured experimentally. Here we use the adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire ({aEIF}) neuron model to determine how subthreshold and spike-triggered slow adaptation currents shape the {PRC}. Based on that, we predict how synchrony and phase locked states of coupled neurons change in presence of synaptic delays and unequal coupling strengths. We find that increased subthreshold adaptation currents cause a transition of the {PRC} from only phase advances to phase advances and delays in response to excitatory perturbations. Increased spike-triggered adaptation currents on the other hand predominantly skew the {PRC} to the right. Both adaptation induced changes of the {PRC} are modulated by spike frequency, being more prominent at lower frequencies. Applying phase reduction theory, we show that subthreshold adaptation stabilizes synchrony for pairs of coupled excitatory neurons, while spike-triggered adaptation causes locking with a small phase difference, as long as synaptic heterogeneities are negligible. For inhibitory pairs synchrony is stable and robust against conduction delays, and adaptation can mediate bistability of in-phase and anti-phase locking. We further demonstrate that stable synchrony and bistable in/anti-phase locking of pairs carry over to synchronization and clustering of larger networks. The effects of adaptation in {aEIF} neurons on {PRCs} and network dynamics qualitatively reflect those of biophysical adaptation currents in detailed {Hodgkin-Huxley}-based neurons, which underscores the utility of the {aEIF} model for investigating the dynamical behavior of networks. Our results suggest neuronal spike frequency adaptation as a mechanism synchronizing low frequency oscillations in local excitatory networks, but indicate that inhibition rather than excitation generates coherent rhythms at higher frequencies. Synchronization of neuronal spiking in the brain is related to cognitive functions, such as perception, attention, and memory. It is therefore important to determine which properties of neurons influence their collective behavior in a network and to understand how. A prominent feature of many cortical neurons is spike frequency adaptation, which is caused by slow transmembrane currents. We investigated how these adaptation currents affect the synchronization tendency of coupled model neurons. Using the efficient adaptive exponential integrate-and-fire ({aEIF}) model and a biophysically detailed neuron model for validation, we found that increased adaptation currents promote synchronization of coupled excitatory neurons at lower spike frequencies, as long as the conduction delays between the neurons are negligible. Inhibitory neurons on the other hand synchronize in presence of conduction delays, with or without adaptation currents. Our results emphasize the utility of the {aEIF} model for computational studies of neuronal network dynamics. We conclude that adaptation currents provide a mechanism to generate low frequency oscillations in local populations of excitatory neurons, while faster rhythms seem to be caused by inhibition rather than excitation.},

@article{Kim12,
	Abstract = {The complex three-dimensional shapes of tree-like structures in biology are constrained by optimization principles, but the actual costs being minimized can be difficult to discern. We show that despite quite variable morphologies and functions, bifurcations in the scleractinian coral Madracis and in many different mammalian neuron types tend to be planar. We prove that in fact bifurcations embedded in a spatial tree that minimizes wiring cost should lie on planes. This biologically motivated generalization of the classical mathematical theory of Euclidean Steiner trees is compatible with many different assumptions about the type of cost function. Since the geometric proof does not require any correlation between consecutive planes, we predict that, in an environment without directional biases, consecutive planes would be oriented independently of each other. We confirm this is true for many branching corals and neuron types. We conclude that planar bifurcations are characteristic of wiring cost optimization in any type of biological spatial tree structure. Morphology is constrained by function and vice-versa. Often, intricate morphology can be explained by optimization of a cost. However, in biology, the exact form of the cost function is seldom clear. Previously, for many different natural trees authors have reported that most bifurcations are planar and we confirm this here for branching corals and mammalian neurons. In a three-dimensional space, where bifurcations can have many shapes, it is not clear why they are mostly planar. We show, using a geometric proof, that bifurcations that are part of an optimal wiring cost tree should be planar. We demonstrate this by proving that a bifurcation that is not planar cannot be part of an optimal wiring cost tree, using a very general form of wiring cost which applies even when the exact form of the cost function is not known. We conclude that nature selects for developmental mechanisms which produce planar bifurcations.},

@article{Putzeys12,
	Abstract = {
                Several studies have reported optimal population decoding of sensory responses in two-alternative visual discrimination tasks. Such decoding involves integrating noisy neural responses into a more reliable representation of the likelihood that the stimuli under consideration evoked the observed responses. Importantly, an ideal observer must be able to evaluate likelihood with high precision and only consider the likelihood of the two relevant stimuli involved in the discrimination task. We report a new perceptual bias suggesting that observers read out the likelihood representation with remarkably low precision when discriminating grating spatial frequencies. Using spectrally filtered noise, we induced an asymmetry in the likelihood function of spatial frequency. This manipulation mainly affects the likelihood of spatial frequencies that are irrelevant to the task at hand. Nevertheless, we find a significant shift in perceived grating frequency, indicating that observers evaluate likelihoods of a broad range of irrelevant frequencies and discard prior knowledge of stimulus alternatives when performing two-alternative discrimination.

@article{Yu12,
	Abstract = {The energy efficiency of neural signal transmission is important not only as a limiting factor in brain architecture, but it also influences the interpretation of functional brain imaging signals. Action potential generation in mammalian, versus invertebrate, axons is remarkably energy efficient. Here we demonstrate that this increase in energy efficiency is due largely to a warmer body temperature. Increases in temperature result in an exponential increase in energy efficiency for single action potentials by increasing the rate of Na(+) channel inactivation, resulting in a marked reduction in overlap of the inward Na(+), and outward K(+), currents and a shortening of action potential duration. This increase in single spike efficiency is, however, counterbalanced by a temperature-dependent decrease in the amplitude and duration of the spike afterhyperpolarization, resulting in a nonlinear increase in the spike firing rate, particularly at temperatures above approximately {35\$\\,^{\\circ}\$C}. Interestingly, the total energy cost, as measured by the multiplication of total Na(+) entry per spike and average firing rate in response to a constant input, reaches a global minimum between {37-42\$\\,^{\\circ}\$C}. Our results indicate that increases in temperature result in an unexpected increase in energy efficiency, especially near normal body temperature, thus allowing the brain to utilize an energy efficient neural code.},

@article{Tsubo12,
	Abstract = {The brain is considered to use a relatively small amount of energy for its efficient information processing. Under a severe restriction on the energy consumption, the maximization of mutual information ({MMI}), which is adequate for designing artificial processing machines, may not suit for the brain. The {MMI} attempts to send information as accurate as possible and this usually requires a sufficient energy supply for establishing clearly discretized communication bands. Here, we derive an alternative hypothesis for neural code from the neuronal activities recorded juxtacellularly in the sensorimotor cortex of behaving rats. Our hypothesis states that in vivo cortical neurons maximize the entropy of neuronal firing under two constraints, one limiting the energy consumption (as assumed previously) and one restricting the uncertainty in output spike sequences at given firing rate. Thus, the conditional maximization of firing-rate entropy ({CMFE}) solves a tradeoff between the energy cost and noise in neuronal response. In short, the {CMFE} sends a rich variety of information through broader communication bands (i.e., widely distributed firing rates) at the cost of accuracy. We demonstrate that the {CMFE} is reflected in the long-tailed, typically power law, distributions of inter-spike intervals obtained for the majority of recorded neurons. In other words, the power-law tails are more consistent with the {CMFE} rather than the {MMI}. Thus, we propose the mathematical principle by which cortical neurons may represent information about synaptic input into their output spike trains.},

Here, we describe a framework to generate random texture movies with controlled information content, i.e., Motion Clouds. These stimuli are defined using a generative model that is based on controlled experimental parametrization. We show that Motion Clouds correspond to dense mixing of localized moving gratings with random positions. Their global envelope is similar to natural-like stimulation with an approximate full-field translation corresponding to a retinal slip. We describe the construction of these stimuli mathematically and propose an open-source Python-based implementation. Examples of the use of this framework are shown. We also propose extensions to other modalities such as color vision, touch, and audition.},

We show that activity in {MT}+, the visual-motion complex in human cortex, does reflect a mix of r and e rather than r alone.

	Abstract = {It has been shown that the perceived direction of a plaid with components of unequal contrast is biased towards the direction of the higher-contrast component [Stone, L. S., Watson, A. B., \& Mulligan, J. B. (1990). Effect of contrast on the perceived direction of a moving plaid. Vision Research 30, 1049-1067]. It was proposed that this effect is due to the influence of contrast on the perceived speed of the plaid components. This led to the conclusion that perceived plaid direction is computed by the intersection of constraints ({IOC}) of the perceived speed of the components rather than their physical speeds. We tested this proposal at a wider range of component speeds (2-16deg/s) than used previously, across which the effect of contrast on perceived speed is seen to reverse. We find that across this range, perceived plaid direction cannot be predicted either by a model which takes the {IOC} of physical or perceived component speed. Our results are consistent with an explanation of {2D} motion perception proposed by [Bowns, L. (1996). Evidence for a feature tracking explanation of why Type {II} plaids move in the vector sum direction at short durations. Vision Research, 36, 3685-3694.] in which the motion of the zero-crossing edges of the features in the stimulus contribute to the perceived direction of motion.},

@article{Bowns11,
	Abstract = {Standard biologically inspired spatio-temporal energy models of how humans perceive moving two-dimensional patterns often have two critical stages. In the first stage, suitable filters are convolved with the pattern over time to extract information at the '' component'' level. Motion energy' is then computed for each component. The second stage typically computes pattern velocity using the intersection of constraints rule ({IOC}). This paper describes a new implementation of the Component Level Feature Model (Bowns, 2002) that computes motion direction that is similar to these two stages except that it does not compute motion energy. Here the model computes direction for 200 randomly generated plaids. The output linearly matched that predicted by the {IOC}. The model was also able to predict the perceived direction even when it deviated from the {IOC} due to the following variables -- speed ratio (Bowns, 1996); duration (Yo \& Wilson, 1992); adaptation (Bowns \& Alais, 2006). The model provides a novel explanation for each of the above and for why multiple directions can be represented for the same stimuli (Bowns \& Alais, 2006); and why some second-order information attributed to non-linearities (Derrington, Badcock, \& Holroyd, 1992) reverses perceived motion direction. Finally, {CLFM} is invariant to contrast and phase.},

@article{Pack01,
	Abstract = {A critical step in the interpretation of the visual world is the integration of the various local motion signals generated by moving objects. This process is complicated by the fact that local velocity measurements can differ depending on contour orientation and spatial position. Specifically, any local motion detector can measure only the component of motion perpendicular to a contour that extends beyond its field of view1, 2. This "aperture problem"3 is particularly relevant to direction-selective neurons early in the visual pathways, where small receptive fields permit only a limited view of a moving object. Here we show that neurons in the middle temporal visual area (known as {MT} or V5) of the macaque brain reveal a dynamic solution to the aperture problem. {MT} neurons initially respond primarily to the component of motion perpendicular to a contour's orientation, but over a period of approximately 60 ms the responses gradually shift to encode the true stimulus direction, regardless of orientation. We also report a behavioural correlate of these neural responses: the initial velocity of pursuit eye movements deviates in a direction perpendicular to local contour orientation, suggesting that the earliest neural responses influence the oculomotor response.},

@article{Howe05,
	Abstract = {If a bar stimulus extends beyond a cell's receptive field, then alterations in binocular disparity parallel to the bar's orientation leave the portion of the stimulus within the cell's receptive field unchanged. This makes it hard for the cell to respond correctly to the bar's disparity. Likening the cell's receptive field to an aperture through which the cell views the world, this issue has been called the "aperture problem" and is a specific form of the more general stereo correspondence problem. We found no cells in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) that, when faced with this situation, were sensitive to the disparity of the bar. However, we did find a number of cells that showed sensitivity to parallel disparity shifts, but these cells responded only to the ends of the long bar. The ability to respond selectively to such tracking features could be the first step towards solving the stereo aperture problem. The second step would require either that the disparity information that in V1 is associated only with the ends of the stimulus be associated with the rest of the stimulus or that subsequent stages of visual processing respond preferentially to the end-selective cells. As this second step does not appear to occur in V1, we conclude that V1 only partially solves the stereo aperture problem.},

@article{Smagt08,
	Abstract = {A horizontally moving grating viewed within a diamond-shaped aperture can be made to appear to move obliquely by introducing appropriate depth-ordering cues (R. O. Duncan, T. D. Albright, \& G. R. Stoner, 2000). It is commonly assumed that the depth cues in such displays determine which line terminators are seen as intrinsic to the grating and which are seen as resulting from occlusion and hence extrinsic to the grating. The ambiguous motion of the grating (arising from the aperture problem) is then supposed to be overcome by selectively pooling motion signals arising from the intrinsic terminators with those arising from the grating while discounting the motion of the extrinsic terminators. In our first experiment, we tested the sufficiency of this explanation. Observers reported the direction of motion of ambiguously moving random dots viewed through a diamond-shaped aperture defined by four panels. Binocular disparity was used to simulate occlusion: two panels occluded the virtual surface upon which the dots were positioned and two panels were occluded by that surface. Reports were significantly biased toward the direction of the occluding panels. Since none of the moving features abutted the surrounding panels, none should have been classified as extrinsic and hence this result cannot have relied on terminator classification. In a second experiment, we tested the hypothesis that depth-ordering cues selectively gate the propagation of motion signals so that the representation of the moving surface extends behind the occluders. This was tested by asking observers to report the direction of moving dots viewed through a briefly "opened" probe window within either occluding or occluded panels. Consistent with our hypothesis, evidence of motion propagation was only found for probe windows within occluding panels. Surprisingly, however, this propagation was only observed when the dots in the inducer window moved away from the probe window, suggesting a "pull," and not a "push" mechanism.},

@article{Shimojo89,
	Abstract = {The "aperture problem" indicates that a local reading of the velocity of an oriented contour is inherently ambiguous, insufficient by itself to recover the velocity of image points. In Wallach's "barber pole" display consisting of moving diagonal lines within an elongated rectangular aperture, it has been suggested that the unambiguous motion of edge-terminators along the longer edges of the aperture propagates towards the motion-ambiguous center part of drifting stripes. This results in the perception of a surface moving in the direction of the longer axis of the aperture. By manipulating the stereoscopic disparity of a striped pattern relative to the aperture plane, we found that the disambiguating effects of terminators could be abolished if the striped pattern was in uncrossed disparity relative to the aperture plane. Also, the motion in 3 separate horizontally oriented, and vertically aligned apertures which would otherwise be seen as moving horizontally, was seen as "linked" together and moving vertically. This occurred only when the horizontally oriented segments separating these apertures were stereoscopically coded so that they appeared as occluders in front. These findings suggest that accidental or "extrinsic" terminators created by occluding edges are treated differently from real or "intrinsic" terminators, and that the real-world constraint of occlusion is thus implemented in the ambiguity-solving processes for motion.},

@article{Beck08b,
	Abstract = {Optic flow is an important cue for object detection. Humans are able to perceive objects in a scene using only kinetic boundaries, and can perform the task even when other shape cues are not provided. These kinetic boundaries are characterized by the presence of motion discontinuities in a local neighbourhood. In addition, temporal occlusions appear along the boundaries as the object in front covers the background and the objects that are spatially behind it. From a technical point of view, the detection of motion boundaries for segmentation based on optic flow is a difficult task. This is due to the problem that flow detected along such boundaries is generally not reliable. We propose a model derived from mechanisms found in visual areas V1, {MT}, and {MSTl} of human and primate cortex that achieves robust detection along motion boundaries. It includes two separate mechanisms for both the detection of motion discontinuities and of occlusion regions based on how neurons respond to spatial and temporal contrast, respectively. The mechanisms are embedded in a biologically inspired architecture that integrates information of different model components of the visual processing due to feedback connections. In particular, mutual interactions between the detection of motion discontinuities and temporal occlusions allow a considerable improvement of the kinetic boundary detection. A new model is proposed that uses optic flow cues to detect motion discontinuities and object occlusion. We suggest that by combining these results for motion discontinuities and object occlusion, object segmentation within the model can be improved. This idea could also be applied in other models for object segmentation. In addition, we discuss how this model is related to neurophysiological findings. The model was successfully tested both with artificial and real sequences including self and object motion.},

	Abstract = {It is known that spatial localization of flashed objects fails around the time of rapid eye movements (saccades). This mislocalization is often interpreted in terms of a combination of shifts and deformations of the brain's representation of space to account for the eye movement. Such temporary remapping of positions in space should affect all elements in a scene, leaving ordinal relationships between positions intact. We performed an experiment in which we presented flashes on a background with red and green regions to human subjects. We found that flashes that were presented on the green part of the background around the time of a saccade were readily reported to have been presented on the red part of the background and vice versa. This is inconsistent with the notion of a temporary shift and deformation of perceived space. To explain our results, we present a model that illustrates how temporal uncertainty could give rise to the observed spatial mislocalization. The model combines uncertainty about the time of the flash with a bias to localize targets where one is looking. It reproduced the pattern of mislocalization very accurately, showing that perisaccadic mislocalization can best be explained in terms of temporal uncertainty about the moment of the flash.},

	Abstract = {Our perception of the space around us is not veridical. It has been reported that the systematic errors in our perception of visual space can be described by a reasonably well-behaving space (the resulting space is approximately projective and complies with an affine geometry). The evidence for this is that the perceived centre of a set of points is independent of the order of the steps taken to construct it. We investigated whether this is also the case in displays with well-known {2-D} visual illusions. In two examples (Judd and Poggendorff illusions), we show that the perceptual centre of a set of points depends on how this centre is constructed. The misperceptions induced by visual illusions are thus of a different nature than our everyday misperceptions. We argue that the concept of perceived visual space is not very useful for describing human behaviour. We propose an alternative description whereby illusions do not deform a visual space, but only a single visual attribute, leaving other attributes unaffected.},

@article{Deco12,
	Abstract = {It is well established that the variability of the neural activity across trials, as measured by the Fano factor, is elevated. This fact poses limits on information encoding by the neural activity. However, a series of recent neurophysiological experiments have changed this traditional view. Single cell recordings across a variety of species, brain areas, brain states and stimulus conditions demonstrate a remarkable reduction of the neural variability when an external stimulation is applied and when attention is allocated towards a stimulus within a neuron's receptive field, suggesting an enhancement of information encoding. Using an heterogeneously connected neural network model whose dynamics exhibits multiple attractors, we demonstrate here how this variability reduction can arise from a network effect. In the spontaneous state, we show that the high degree of neural variability is mainly due to fluctuation-driven excursions from attractor to attractor. This occurs when, in the parameter space, the network working point is around the bifurcation allowing multistable attractors. The application of an external excitatory drive by stimulation or attention stabilizes one specific attractor, eliminating in this way the transitions between the different attractors and resulting in a net decrease in neural variability over trials. Importantly, non-responsive neurons also exhibit a reduction of variability. Finally, this reduced variability is found to arise from an increased regularity of the neural spike trains. In conclusion, these results suggest that the variability reduction under stimulation and attention is a property of neural circuits.},

	Abstract = {The human visual system has the remarkable ability to largely recognize objects invariant of their position, rotation, and scale. A good interpretation of neurobiological findings involves a computational model that simulates signal processing of the visual cortex. In part, this is likely achieved step by step from early to late areas of visual perception. While several algorithms have been proposed for learning feature detectors, only few studies at hand cover the issue of biologically plausible learning of such invariance. In this study, a set of Hebbian learning rules based on calcium dynamics and homeostatic regulations of single neurons is proposed. Their performance is verified within a simple model of the primary visual cortex to learn so-called complex cells, based on a sequence of static images. As a result, the learned complex-cell responses are largely invariant to phase and position.},

@article{Losonczy08,
	Abstract = {Although information storage in the central nervous system is thought to be primarily mediated by various forms of synaptic plasticity, other mechanisms, such as modifications in membrane excitability, are available. Local dendritic spikes are nonlinear voltage events that are initiated within dendritic branches by spatially clustered and temporally synchronous synaptic input. That local spikes selectively respond only to appropriately correlated input allows them to function as input feature detectors and potentially as powerful information storage mechanisms. However, it is currently unknown whether any effective form of local dendritic spike plasticity exists. Here we show that the coupling between local dendritic spikes and the soma of rat hippocampal {CA1} pyramidal neurons can be modified in a branch-specific manner through an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor ({NMDAR})-dependent regulation of dendritic Kv4.2 potassium channels. These data suggest that compartmentalized changes in branch excitability could store multiple complex features of synaptic input, such as their spatio-temporal correlation. We propose that this 'branch strength potentiation' represents a previously unknown form of information storage that is distinct from that produced by changes in synaptic efficacy both at the mechanistic level and in the type of information stored.},

@article{Cicchini12,
	Abstract = {Both theoretical and experimental evidence suggests that duration perception is mediated preferentially by the color-blind but high temporally sensitive luminance pathway. In this experiment we tested whether color modulated stimuli and high spatial frequency luminance modulated stimuli, which are known to be relayed mostly by the slow parvocellular system, are able to elicit reliable sense of duration. We show that ramped color modulated stimuli seem to last less than luminance modulated stimuli matched for visibility. The effect is large, about 200 ms and is constant at all durations tested (range 500-1100 ms). However, high spatial frequency luminance stimuli obtain duration matches similar to those of low spatial frequency luminance modulated stimuli. The results at various levels of contrast and temporal smoothing indicate that equiluminant stimuli have higher contrast thresholds to activate the mechanisms which time visual stimuli. Overall the results imply that both the magnocellular and the parvocellular systems access reliably the timing mechanisms with a difference only in the way these are engaged.},

@article{Cadieu11,
	Abstract = {We present a model of intermediate-level visual representation that is based on learning invariances from movies of the natural environment. The model is composed of two stages of processing: an early feature representation layer and a second layer in which invariances are explicitly represented. Invariances are learned as the result of factoring apart the temporally stable and dynamic components embedded in the early feature representation. The structure contained in these components is made explicit in the activities of second-layer units that capture invariances in both form and motion. When trained on natural movies, the first layer produces a factorization, or separation, of image content into a temporally persistent part representing local edge structure and a dynamic part representing local motion structure, consistent with known response properties in early visual cortex (area V1). This factorization linearizes statistical dependencies among the first-layer units, making them learnable by the second layer. The second-layer units are split into two populations according to the factorization in the first layer. The form-selective units receive their input from the temporally persistent part (local edge structure) and after training result in a diverse set of higher-order shape features consisting of extended contours, multiscale edges, textures, and texture boundaries. The motion-selective units receive their input from the dynamic part (local motion structure) and after training result in a representation of image translation over different spatial scales and directions, in addition to more complex deformations. These representations provide a rich description of dynamic natural images and testable hypotheses regarding intermediate-level representation in visual cortex.},

@article{Lawhern12,
	Abstract = {Significant progress has been made within the last decade in motor cortical decoding that predicts movement behaviors from population neuronal activity in the motor cortex. A majority of these decoding methods have focused on estimating a subject's hand trajectory in a continuous movement. We recently proposed a time identification decoding approach and showed that if a stereotyped movement is well represented by a sequence of targets (or landmarks), then the main structure of the movement can be reconstructed by detecting the reaching times at those targets. Both trajectory decoding and landmark-time decoding have their particular advantages, whereas a coupling of these two different strategies has not been examined. In this article we propose a synergy that comes from combining these two approaches for a stereotyped movement under a linear state-space framework. We develop a new decoding procedure based on a forward--backward propagation where the target is used in the initial stage in the backward step. Experimental results show that the new method significantly improves decoding accuracy over the non-target-included models. Furthermore, the coupling based on the new target-included method effectively combines the time decoding and trajectory decoding and further improves the decoding accuracy.},

@article{Gustafson11,
	Abstract = {Reinforcement learning ({RL}) provides an influential characterization of the brain's mechanisms for learning to make advantageous choices. An important problem, though, is how complex tasks can be represented in a way that enables efficient learning. We consider this problem through the lens of spatial navigation, examining how two of the brain's location representations---hippocampal place cells and entorhinal grid cells---are adapted to serve as basis functions for approximating value over space for {RL}. Although much previous work has focused on these systems' roles in combining upstream sensory cues to track location, revisiting these representations with a focus on how they support this downstream decision function offers complementary insights into their characteristics. Rather than localization, the key problem in learning is generalization between past and present situations, which may not match perfectly. Accordingly, although neural populations collectively offer a precise representation of position, our simulations of navigational tasks verify the suggestion that {RL} gains efficiency from the more diffuse tuning of individual neurons, which allows learning about rewards to generalize over longer distances given fewer training experiences. However, work on generalization in {RL} suggests the underlying representation should respect the environment's layout. In particular, although it is often assumed that neurons track location in Euclidean coordinates (that a place cell's activity declines '' as the crow flies'' away from its peak), the relevant metric for value is geodesic: the distance along a path, around any obstacles. We formalize this intuition and present simulations showing how Euclidean, but not geodesic, representations can interfere with {RL} by generalizing inappropriately across barriers. Our proposal that place and grid responses should be modulated by geodesic distances suggests novel predictions about how obstacles should affect spatial firing fields, which provides a new viewpoint on data concerning both spatial codes. The central problem of learning is generalization: how to apply what was discovered in past experiences to future situations, which will inevitably be the same in some respects and different in others. Effective learning requires generalizing appropriately: to situations which are similar in relevant respects, though of course the trick is determining what is relevant. In this article, we quantify and investigate relevant generalization in the context of a particular learning problem often studied in the laboratory: learning to navigate in a spatial maze. In particular, we consider whether the brain's well-characterized systems for representing an organism's location in space generalize appropriately for this task. Our simulations of learning verify that to generalize effectively, these representations should treat nearby locations similarly (that is, neurons should fire similarly when an animal occupies nearby locations)---but, more subtly, that to enable successful learning, '' nearby'' must be defined in terms of paths around obstacles, rather than in absolute space '' as the crow flies.'' These considerations suggest new principles for understanding these spatial representations and why they appear warped and distorted in environments, such as mazes, with barriers and obstacles.},

	Abstract = {Oriented edges in images of natural scenes tend to be aligned in collinear or co-circular arrangements, with lines and smooth curves more common than other possible arrangements of edges (Geisler et al., Vis Res 41:711-24, 2001). The visual system appears to take advantage of this prior information, and human contour detection and grouping performance is well predicted by such an "association field" (Field et al., Vis Res 33:173-93, 1993). One possible candidate substrate for implementing an association field in mammals is the set of long-range lateral connections between neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1), which could act to facilitate detection of contours matching the association field, and/or inhibit detection of other contours (Choe and Miikkulainen, Biol Cyb 90:75-88, 2004). To fill this role, the lateral connections would need to be orientation specific and aligned along contours, and indeed such an arrangement has been found in tree shrew primary visual cortex (Bosking et al., J Neurosci 17:2112-27, 1997). However, it is not yet known whether these patterns develop as a result of visual experience, or are simply hard-wired to be appropriate for the statistics of natural scenes. To investigate this issue, we examined the properties of the visual environment of laboratory animals, to determine whether the observed connection patterns are more similar to the statistics of the rearing environment or of a natural habitat. Specifically, we analyzed the cooccurence statistics of edge elements in images of natural scenes, and compared them to corresponding statistics for images taken from within the rearing environment of the animals in the Bosking et al. (1997) study. We used a modified version of the algorithm from Geisler et al. (2001), with a more general edge extraction algorithm that uses sparse coding to avoid multiple responses to a single edge. Collinearity and co-circularity results for natural images replicated qualitatively the results from Geisler et al. (2001), confirming that prior information about continuations appeared consistently in natural images. However, we find that the largely man-made environment in which these animals were reared has a significantly higher probability of collinear edge elements. We thus predict that if the lateral connection patterns are due to visual experience, the patterns in wild-raised tree shrews would be very different from those measured by Bosking et al. (1997), with shorter-range correlations and less emphasis on collinear continuations. This prediction can be tested in future experiments on matching groups of animals reared in different environments. {W.H}. Bosking and Y. Zhang and B. Schofield and D.

	Abstract = {Spatial context in images induces perceptual phenomena associated with salience and modulates the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual effects are incompletely understood. We introduce a model of natural images that includes grouping and segmentation of neighboring features based on their joint statistics, and we interpret the firing rates of V1 neurons as performing optimal recognition in this model. We show that this leads to a substantial generalization of divisive normalization, a computation that is ubiquitous in many neural areas and systems. A main novelty in our model is that the influence of the context on a target stimulus is determined by their degree of statistical dependence. We optimized the parameters of the model on natural image patches, and then simulated neural and perceptual responses on stimuli used in classical experiments. The model reproduces some rich and complex response patterns observed in V1, such as the contrast dependence, orientation tuning and spatial asymmetry of surround suppression, while also allowing for surround facilitation under conditions of weak stimulation. It also mimics the perceptual salience produced by simple displays, and leads to readily testable predictions. Our results provide a principled account of orientation-based contextual modulation in early vision and its sensitivity to the homogeneity and spatial arrangement of inputs, and lends statistical support to the theory that V1 computes visual salience.},

@article{Vavoulis12,
	Abstract = {Traditional approaches to the problem of parameter estimation in biophysical models of neurons and neural networks usually adopt a global search algorithm (for example, an evolutionary algorithm), often in combination with a local search method (such as gradient descent) in order to minimize the value of a cost function, which measures the discrepancy between various features of the available experimental data and model output. In this study, we approach the problem of parameter estimation in conductance-based models of single neurons from a different perspective. By adopting a hidden-dynamical-systems formalism, we expressed parameter estimation as an inference problem in these systems, which can then be tackled using a range of well-established statistical inference methods. The particular method we used was Kitagawa's self-organizing state-space model, which was applied on a number of {Hodgkin-Huxley}-type models using simulated or actual electrophysiological data. We showed that the algorithm can be used to estimate a large number of parameters, including maximal conductances, reversal potentials, kinetics of ionic currents, measurement and intrinsic noise, based on low-dimensional experimental data and sufficiently informative priors in the form of pre-defined constraints imposed on model parameters. The algorithm remained operational even when very noisy experimental data were used. Importantly, by combining the self-organizing state-space model with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy, we achieved a significant reduction in the variance of parameter estimates. The algorithm did not require the explicit formulation of a cost function and it was straightforward to apply on compartmental models and multiple data sets. Overall, the proposed methodology is particularly suitable for resolving high-dimensional inference problems based on noisy electrophysiological data and, therefore, a potentially useful tool in the construction of biophysical neuron models. Parameter estimation is a problem of central importance and, perhaps, the most laborious task in biophysical modeling of neurons and neural networks. An emerging trend is to treat parameter estimation in this context as yet another statistical inference problem, which can be tackled using well-established methods from Computational Statistics. Inspired by these recent advances, we adopted a self-organizing state-space-model approach augmented with an adaptive sampling algorithm akin to the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy in order to estimate a large number of parameters in a number of {Hodgkin-Huxley}-type models of single neurons. Parameter estimation was based on noisy electrophysiological data and involved the maximal conductances, reversal potentials, levels of noise and, unlike most mainstream work, the kinetics of ionic currents in the examined models. Our main conclusion was that parameters in complex, conductance-based neuron models can be inferred using the aforementioned methodology, if sufficiently informative priors regarding the unknown model parameters are available. Importantly, the use of an adaptive algorithm for sampling new parameter vectors significantly reduced the variance of parameter estimates. Flexibility and scalability are additional advantages of the proposed method, which is particularly suited to resolve high-dimensional inference problems.},

@article{Lorincz12,
	Abstract = {Sensory representations are not only sparse, but often overcomplete: coding units significantly outnumber the input units. For models of neural coding this overcompleteness poses a computational challenge for shaping the signal processing channels as well as for using the large and sparse representations in an efficient way. We argue that higher level overcompleteness becomes computationally tractable by imposing sparsity on synaptic activity and we also show that such structural sparsity can be facilitated by statistics based decomposition of the stimuli into typical and atypical parts prior to sparse coding. Typical parts represent large-scale correlations, thus they can be significantly compressed. Atypical parts, on the other hand, represent local features and are the subjects of actual sparse coding. When applied on natural images, our decomposition based sparse coding model can efficiently form overcomplete codes and both center-surround and oriented filters are obtained similar to those observed in the retina and the primary visual cortex, respectively. Therefore we hypothesize that the proposed computational architecture can be seen as a coherent functional model of the first stages of sensory coding in early vision. Neural systems favor overcomplete sparse codes in which the number of potential output neurons may exceed the number of input neurons, but only a small subset of neurons become actually active. We argue that efficient use of such large dimensional overcomplete sparse codes requires structural sparsity by controlling the number of active synapses. Motivated by recent results in signal recovery, we introduce a particular signal decomposition as a pre-filtering stage prior to the actual sparse coding, which efficiently supports structural sparsity. In contrast to most models of sensory processing, we hypothesize that the observed transformations may actually realize parallel encoding of the stimuli into representations that describe typical and atypical parts. When trained on natural images, the resulting system can handle large, overcomplete representations and the learned transformations seem compatible with the various receptive fields characteristic to different stages of early vision. In particular, transformations realized by the prefiltering units can be approximated as '{Difference-of-Gaussians}' filters, similar to the receptive fields of neurons in the retina and the {LGN}. In addition, sparse coding units have localized and oriented edge filters like the receptive fields of the simple cells in the primary visual cortex, V1.},

@article{Gerhard11,
	Abstract = {
                The simultaneous recording of the activity of many neurons poses challenges for multivariate data analysis. Here, we propose a general scheme of reconstruction of the functional network from spike train recordings. Effective, causal interactions are estimated by fitting generalized linear models on the neural responses, incorporating effects of the neurons' self-history, of input from other neurons in the recorded network and of modulation by an external stimulus. The coupling terms arising from synaptic input can be transformed by thresholding into a binary connectivity matrix which is directed. Each link between two neurons represents a causal influence from one neuron to the other, given the observation of all other neurons from the population. The resulting graph is analyzed with respect to small-world and scale-free properties using quantitative measures for directed networks. Such graph-theoretic analyses have been performed on many complex dynamic networks, including the connectivity structure between different brain areas. Only few studies have attempted to look at the structure of cortical neural networks on the level of individual neurons. Here, using multi-electrode recordings from the visual system of the awake monkey, we find that cortical networks lack scale-free behavior, but show a small, but significant small-world structure. Assuming a simple distance-dependent probabilistic wiring between neurons, we find that this connectivity structure can account for all of the networks' observed small-world ness. Moreover, for multi-electrode recordings the sampling of neurons is not uniform across the population. We show that the small-world-ness obtained by such a localized sub-sampling overestimates the strength of the true small-world structure of the network. This bias is likely to be present in all previous experiments based on multi-electrode recordings.

	Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that the brain relies on a set of canonical neural computations, repeating them across brain regions and modalities to apply similar operations to different problems. A promising candidate for such a computation is normalization, in which the responses of neurons are divided by a common factor that typically includes the summed activity of a pool of neurons. Normalization was developed to explain responses in the primary visual cortex and is now thought to operate throughout the visual system, and in many other sensory modalities and brain regions. Normalization may underlie operations such as the representation of odours, the modulatory effects of visual attention, the encoding of value and the integration of multisensory information. Its presence in such a diversity of neural systems in multiple species, from invertebrates to mammals, suggests that it serves as a canonical neural computation.},

@article{Borgers12,
	Abstract = {In networks of excitatory and inhibitory neurons with mutual synaptic coupling, specific drive to sub-ensembles of cells often leads to gamma-frequency (25-100 Hz) oscillations. When the number of driven cells is too small, however, the synaptic interactions may not be strong or homogeneous enough to support the mechanism underlying the rhythm. Using a combination of computational simulation and mathematical analysis, we study the breakdown of gamma rhythms as the driven ensembles become too small, or the synaptic interactions become too weak and heterogeneous. Heterogeneities in drives or synaptic strengths play an important role in the breakdown of the rhythms; nonetheless, we find that the analysis of homogeneous networks yields insight into the breakdown of rhythms in heterogeneous networks. In particular, if parameter values are such that in a homogeneous network, it takes several gamma cycles to converge to synchrony, then in a similar, but realistically heterogeneous network, synchrony breaks down altogether. This leads to the surprising conclusion that in a network with realistic heterogeneity, gamma rhythms based on the interaction of excitatory and inhibitory cell populations must arise either rapidly, or not at all. For given synaptic strengths and heterogeneities, there is a (soft) lower bound on the possible number of cells in an ensemble oscillating at gamma frequency, based simply on the requirement that synaptic interactions between the two cell populations be strong enough. This observation suggests explanations for recent experimental results concerning the modulation of gamma oscillations in macaque primary visual cortex by varying spatial stimulus size or attention level, and for our own experimental results, reported here, concerning the optogenetic modulation of gamma oscillations in kainate-activated hippocampal slices. We make specific predictions about the behavior of pyramidal cells and fast-spiking interneurons in these experiments.},

Paradoxically, the second stimulus biases decisions more strongly than the first one, contrary to predictions of one-stage models and intuition.

@article{Antolik11,
	Abstract = {Hubel and Wiesel (1962) classified primary visual cortex (V1) neurons as either simple, with responses modulated by the spatial phase of a sine grating, or complex, i.e., largely phase invariant. Much progress has been made in understanding how simple-cells develop, and there are now detailed computational models establishing how they can form topographic maps ordered by orientation preference. There are also models of how complex cells can develop using outputs from simple cells with different phase preferences, but no model of how a topographic orientation map of complex cells could be formed based on the actual connectivity patterns found in V1. Addressing this question is important, because the majority of existing developmental models of simple-cell maps group neurons selective to similar spatial phases together, which is contrary to experimental evidence, and makes it difficult to construct complex cells. Overcoming this limitation is not trivial, because mechanisms responsible for map development drive receptive fields ({RF}) of nearby neurons to be highly correlated, while co-oriented {RFs} of opposite phases are anti-correlated. In this work, we model V1 as two topographically organized sheets representing cortical layer 4 and 2/3. Only layer 4 receives direct thalamic input. Both sheets are connected with narrow feed-forward and feedback connectivity. Only layer 2/3 contains strong long-range lateral connectivity, in line with current anatomical findings. Initially all weights in the model are random, and each is modified via a Hebbian learning rule. The model develops smooth, matching, orientation preference maps in both sheets. Layer 4 units become simple cells, with phase preference arranged randomly, while those in layer 2/3 are primarily complex cells. To our knowledge this model is the first explaining how simple cells can develop with random phase preference, and how maps of complex cells can develop, using only realistic patterns of connectivity.},

@article{Wilson10,
	Abstract = {Based on measuring responses to rat whiskers as they are mechanically stimulated, one recent study suggests that barrel-related areas in layer 2/3 rat primary somatosensory cortex (S1) contain a pinwheel map of whisker motion directions. Because this map is reminiscent of topographic organization for visual direction in primary visual cortex (V1) of higher mammals, we asked whether the S1 pinwheels could be explained by an input-driven developmental process as is often suggested for V1. We developed a computational model to capture how whisker stimuli are conveyed to supragranular S1, and simulate lateral cortical interactions using an established self-organizing algorithm. Inputs to the model each represent the deflection of a subset of 25 whiskers as they are contacted by a moving stimulus object. The subset of deflected whiskers corresponds with the shape of the stimulus, and the deflection direction corresponds with the movement direction of the stimulus. If these two features of the inputs are correlated during the training of the model, a somatotopically aligned map of direction emerges for each whisker in S1. Predictions of the model that are immediately testable include (1) that somatotopic pinwheel maps of whisker direction exist in adult layer 2/3 barrel cortex for every large whisker on the rat's face, even peripheral whiskers; and (2) in the adult, neurons with similar directional tuning are interconnected by a network of horizontal connections, spanning distances of many whisker representations. We also propose specific experiments for testing the predictions of the model by manipulating patterns of whisker inputs experienced during early development. The results suggest that similar intracortical mechanisms guide the development of primate V1 and rat S1.},

@article{Mirabet12,
	Abstract = {A striking feature of vascular plants is the regular arrangement of lateral organs on the stem, known as phyllotaxis. The most common phyllotactic patterns can be described using spirals, numbers from the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle. This rich mathematical structure, along with the experimental reproduction of phyllotactic spirals in physical systems, has led to a view of phyllotaxis focusing on regularity. However all organisms are affected by natural stochastic variability, raising questions about the effect of this variability on phyllotaxis and the achievement of such regular patterns. Here we address these questions theoretically using a dynamical system of interacting sources of inhibitory field. Previous work has shown that phyllotaxis can emerge deterministically from the self-organization of such sources and that inhibition is primarily mediated by the depletion of the plant hormone auxin through polarized transport. We incorporated stochasticity in the model and found three main classes of defects in spiral phyllotaxis -- the reversal of the handedness of spirals, the concomitant initiation of organs and the occurrence of distichous angles -- and we investigated whether a secondary inhibitory field filters out defects. Our results are consistent with available experimental data and yield a prediction of the main source of stochasticity during organogenesis. Our model can be related to cellular parameters and thus provides a framework for the analysis of phyllotactic mutants at both cellular and tissular levels. We propose that secondary fields associated with organogenesis, such as other biochemical signals or mechanical forces, are important for the robustness of phyllotaxis. More generally, our work sheds light on how a target pattern can be achieved within a noisy background. How living organisms affected by natural, stochastic variability achieve regular developmental patterns is a challenging question in biology. A fitting field of investigation is provided by phyllotaxis, the regular arrangements of lateral organs such as leaves or flowers on the stem of vascular plants, as visible on a pinecone or a sunflower head. In spiral phyllotaxis, the most frequent amongst higher plants, these arrangements can be described using spirals, numbers from the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle, which has led to an ideal, deterministic view of phyllotaxis. Nevertheless, organ initiation can be influenced by cellular and organismal noise. In order to investigate the effect of such noise, and how it might be regulated, we developed a stochastic dynamical model of the inhibitory interactions between organs. Our model predicts stereotypical alterations of phyllotactic patterns, recapitulating disparate observations. Comparing simulations and experiments, we identified the main source of noise affecting phyllotaxis in planta. We further propose a generic mechanism of noise regulation through a secondary signal and predict its parameters for an optimal efficiency. More generally, our work suggests that noise can have visible macroscopic effects on developmental phenotypes, and that different layers of control are required to modulate these effects.},

@article{Pack03,
	Abstract = {Our perception of fine visual detail relies on small receptive fields at early stages of visual processing. However, small receptive fields tend to confound the orientation and velocity of moving edges, leading to ambiguous or inaccurate motion measurements (the aperture problem). Thus, it is often assumed that neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) carry only ambiguous motion information. Here we show that a subpopulation of V1 neurons is capable of signaling motion direction in a manner that is independent of contour orientation. Specifically, end-stopped V1 neurons obtain accurate motion measurements by responding only to the endpoints of long contours, a strategy which renders them largely immune to the aperture problem. Furthermore, the time course of end-stopping is similar to the time course of motion integration by {MT} neurons. These results suggest that cortical neurons might represent object motion by responding selectively to two-dimensional discontinuities in the visual scene.},

In this paper, using experimental data, we show that color does not affect where observers look when viewing natural scene images. Neither colors nor abnormal colors modify observers' fixation locations when compared to the same scenes in grayscale. In the same way, we did not find any significant difference between the scanpaths under grayscale, color, or abnormal color viewing conditions. However, we observed a decrease in fixation duration for color and abnormal color, and this was particularly true at the beginning of scene exploration. Finally, we found that abnormal color modifies saccade amplitude distribution.},

	Abstract = {Mushroom bodies are a well-known site for associative learning in insects. Yet the precise mechanisms that underlie plasticity there and ensure their specificity remain elusive. In locusts, the synapses between the intrinsic mushroom body neurons and their postsynaptic targets obey a Hebbian spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) rule. Although this property homeostatically regulates the timing of mushroom body output, its potential role in associative learning is unknown. Here we show in vivo that pre-post pairing causing {STDP} can, when followed by the local delivery of a reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator, specify the synapses that will undergo an associative change. At these synapses, and there only, the change is a transformation of the {STDP} rule itself. These results illustrate the multiple actions of {STDP}, including a role in associative learning, despite potential temporal dissociation between the pairings that specify synaptic modification and the delivery of reinforcement-mediating neuromodulator signals.},

@incollection{Masson10,
	Abstract = {To accurately track a moving object of interest with appropriate smooth eye movements, the brain needs to reconstruct a single velocity vector describing the global motion of this object. Because of the aperture problem (see Chap. 1), the visual system must integrate piecewise local information from either elongated edges and contours or particular features such as corners and texture elements. Here, we show that investigating smooth eye movements unveil several dynamical properties of this visual motion integration stage. Signals are weighted according to their uncertainties. The integration is highly dynamical - eye movements being always launched first in the simplest, linear (vector sum) prediction. Tracking trajectories are then progressively adjusted to match the object trajectory after 200 ms of pursuit. Such strategy is immune to higher factors such as prediction about incoming {2D} target trajectory. On the contrary, mixing retinal and extra-retinal signals become important later during the pursuit to accommodate partial or total object motion occlusion for instance. We propose a framework computing and representing object motion through two recurrent loops ({V1-MT} and {MST}-{FEF}, respectively), with area {MST} playing the role of gear. Such architecture would accommodate two important constraints of motor behavior: quick reaction to a new visual event and utilization of extra-retinal information to smooth out transient changes in the image such as those occurring when an object moves in a crowded environment.},

Here we investigate tactile motion processing using stimuli whose perceptual properties have been well established in vision research, namely superimposed gratings (plaids), barber poles, and bar fields. In both modalities, information about stimulus motion (speed and direction) conveyed by neurons at low levels of sensory processing is ambiguous, a conundrum known as the aperture problem. Our results suggest that the tactile perception of motion, analogous to its visual counterpart, operates in multiple stages: first, the perceived direction of motion is determined by a majority vote from local motion detectors, which are subject to the aperture problem. As in vision, the conflict between the cues from terminators and other local motion cues is gradually resolved over time so that the perceived direction approaches the veridical direction of motion.},

	Abstract = {Neuronal populations in the primary visual cortex (V1) of mammals exhibit contrast normalization. Neurons that respond strongly to simple visual stimuli -- such as sinusoidal gratings --respond less well to the same stimuli when they are presented as part of a more complex stimulus which also excites other, neighboring neurons. This phenomenon is generally attributed to generalized patterns of inhibitory connections between nearby V1 neurons. The Bienenstock, Cooper \& Munro ({BCM}) rule is a neural network learning rule that, when trained on natural images, produces model neurons which, individually, have many tuning properties in common with real V1 neurons. However, when viewed as a population, a {BCM} network is very different from V1 -- each member of the {BCM} population tends to respond to the same dominant features of visual input, producing an incomplete, highly redundant code for visual information. Here, we demonstrate that, by adding contrast normalization into the {BCM} rule, we arrive at a neurally-plausible Hebbian learning rule that can learn an efficient sparse, overcomplete representation that is a better model for stimulus selectivity in V1.

	Abstract = {Researchers have conjectured that eye movements during visual search are selected to minimize the number of saccades. The optimal Bayesian eye movement strategy minimizing saccades does not simply direct the eye to whichever location is judged most likely to contain the target but makes use of the entire retina as an information gathering device during each fixation. Here we show that human observers do not minimize the expected number of saccades in planning saccades in a simple visual search task composed of three tokens. In this task, the optimal eye movement strategy varied, depending on the spacing between tokens (in the first experiment) or the size of tokens (in the second experiment), and changed abruptly once the separation or size surpassed a critical value. None of our observers changed strategy as a function of separation or size. Human performance fell far short of ideal, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

@article{Middleton12,
	Abstract = {Correlated variability of neural spiking activity has important consequences for signal processing. How incoming sensory signals shape correlations of population responses remains unclear. Cross-correlations between spiking of different neurons may be particularly consequential in sparsely firing neural populations such as those found in layer 2/3 of sensory cortex. In rat whisker barrel cortex, we found that pairs of excitatory layer 2/3 neurons exhibit similarly low levels of spike count correlation during both spontaneous and sensory-evoked states. The spontaneous activity of excitatory-inhibitory neuron pairs is positively correlated, while sensory stimuli actively decorrelate joint responses. Computational modeling shows how threshold nonlinearities and local inhibition form the basis of a general decorrelating mechanism. We show that inhibitory population activity maintains low correlations in excitatory populations, especially during periods of sensory-evoked coactivation. The role of feedforward inhibition has been previously described in the context of trial-averaged phenomena. Our findings reveal a novel role for inhibition to shape correlations of neural variability and thereby prevent excessive correlations in the face of feedforward sensory-evoked activation.},

@article{Hancock10,
	Abstract = {Little is known about the way in which the outputs of early orientation-selective neurons are combined. One particular problem is that the number of possible combinations of these outputs greatly outweighs the number of processing units available to represent them. Here we consider two of the possible ways in which the visual system might reduce the impact of this problem. First, the visual system might ameliorate the problem by collapsing across some low-level feature coded by previous processing stages, such as spatial frequency. Second, the visual system may combine only a subset of available outputs, such as those with similar receptive field characteristics. Using plaid-selective contrast adaptation and the curvature aftereffect, we found no evidence for the former solution; both aftereffects were clearly tuned to the spatial frequency of the adaptor relative to the test probe. We did, however, find evidence for the latter with both aftereffects; when the components forming our compound stimuli were dissimilar in spatial frequency, the effects of adapting to them were substantially reduced. This has important implications for mid-level visual processing, both for the combinatorial explosion and for the selective "binding" of common features that are perceived as coming from a single visual object.},

@article{McGovern11,
	Abstract = {Temporal information in a scene is thought to be an important cue for visual grouping of local image features into a single object. The majority of studies on this topic have attempted to determine the conditions that facilitate segregation of a figure from a cluttered background. Here we examine the temporal characteristics of two aftereffects that appear to have roles in visual integration: the curvature aftereffect ({CAE}; Hancock \& Peirce, 2008) and plaid-selective contrast adaptation (Peirce \& Taylor, 2006). Both aftereffects used a "compound adaptation" paradigm measuring adaptation to a compound stimulus that cannot be explained by adaptation to its components presented in isolation. The temporal tuning characteristics of the two aftereffects differed in three distinct ways. First, plaid-selective adaptation was very sensitive to temporal phase asynchronies, while the {CAE} was not. Second, while both aftereffects showed integration of alternating components above 4 Hz, for plaids the overall magnitude of adaptation was less than to synchronous stimuli and was eliminated at the highest frequencies. Finally, plaid-selective adaptation demonstrated a low-pass dependency for temporal flicker frequency of synchronous gratings, whereas the {CAE} did not. Overall, these results suggest that at least two different mechanisms are involved in the binding/segregation of local signals into compound patterns: one with high temporal resolution that allows rapid parsing of plaid patterns into their components and one with a coarser temporal sensitivity that mediates the {CAE}.

First, we determine a linear combination of all the training samples that best represents the test sample and delete the training sample whose coefficient has the minimum absolute value. Then a similar procedure is carried out for the remaining training samples and this procedure is repeatedly carried out till the predefined termination condition is satisfied. The finally remaining training samples are used to produce a best representation of the test sample and to classify it. The face recognition experiments show that the proposed method can achieve promising classification accuracy.},

@article{Diekhof10,
	Abstract = {Human decisions are guided by "desire" or "reason," which control actions oriented toward either proximal or long-term goals. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess how the human brain mediates the balance between proximal reward desiring and long-term goals, when actions promoting a superordinate goal preclude exploitation of an immediately available reward option. Consistent with the view that the reward system interacts with prefrontal circuits during action control, we found that behavior favoring the long-term goal, but counteracting immediate reward desiring, relied on a negative functional interaction of anteroventral prefrontal cortex ({avPFC}) with nucleus accumbens (Nacc) and ventral tegmental area. The degree of functional interaction between {avPFC} and Nacc further predicted behavioral success during pursuit of the distal goal, when confronted with a proximal reward option, and scaled with interindividual differences in trait impulsivity. These findings reveal how the human brain accomplishes voluntary action control guided by "reason," suggesting that inhibitory {avPFC} influences Nacc activity during actions requiring a restraint of immediate "desires." {10.1523/JNEUROSCI}.4690-09.2010},

On the other hand, little work has been done using a more natural sparseness measure, the \^{a}0-pseudo-norm. In this paper, we propose a framework for approximate {NMF} which constrains the \^{a}0-norm of the basis matrix, or the coefficient matrix, respectively. For this purpose, techniques for unconstrained {NMF} can be easily incorporated, such as multiplicative update rules, or the alternating nonnegative least-squares scheme.

@article{Hull12,
	Abstract = {Here we provide evidence that revises the inhibitory circuit diagram of the cerebellar cortex. It was previously thought that Golgi cells, interneurons that are the sole source of inhibition onto granule cells, were exclusively coupled via gap junctions. Moreover, Golgi cells were believed to receive {GABAergic} inhibition from molecular layer interneurons ({MLIs}). Here we challenge these views by optogenetically activating the cerebellar circuitry to determine the timing and pharmacology of inhibition onto Golgi cells and by performing paired recordings to directly assess synaptic connectivity. In contrast to current thought, we find that Golgi cells, not {MLIs}, make inhibitory {GABAergic} synapses onto other Golgi cells. As a result, {MLI} feedback does not regulate the Golgi cell network, and Golgi cells are inhibited approximately 2 ms before Purkinje cells, following a mossy fiber input. Hence, Golgi cells and Purkinje cells receive unique sources of inhibition and can differentially process shared granule cell inputs. Copyright {\\copyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Four original illusions {based on Gaetano Kanisza's [Kanizsa G (1976) Subjective contours. Sci Am 234:48--52] and Akiyoshi Kitaoka's [Kitaoka A. (2005) Trick Eyes (Barnes \& Noble, New Providence, NJ).] examples} were manipulated to obtain control conditions in which the perceived illusory luminance was either eliminated or reduced. All stimuli were equiluminant so that constrictions in pupillary size could not be ascribed to changes in light energy. We found that the pupillary diameter rapidly varied according to perceived brightness and lightness strength. Differences in local contrast information could be ruled out as an explanation because, in a second experiment, the observers maintained eye fixation in the center of the display; thus, differential stimulation of the fovea by local contrast changes could not be responsible for the pupillary differences. Hence, the most parsimonious explanation for the present findings is that pupillary responses to ambient light reflect the perceived brightness or lightness of the scene and not simply the amount of physical light energy entering the eye. Thus, the pupillary physiological response reflects the subjective perception of light and supports the idea that the brain's visual circuitry is shaped by visual experience with images and their possible sources.},

	Abstract = {Recently, functional interactions between anteroventral prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens ({NAcc}) have been shown to relate to behavior counteracting reward-desiring (Diekhof and Gruber, 2010). Downregulation of the reward system by serotonin has also been suggested as the mode of action accounting for unsatisfactory effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors ({SSRIs}) such as insufficient alleviation or even increase of anhedonia, and loss of interest. However, understanding of the in vivo mechanisms of {SSRI}-related alteration of the human reward system is still incomplete. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) within a double-blind cross-over within-subjects study design and administering the {SSRI} paroxetine, the dopamine/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor bupropione, and placebo for 7 d each, we investigated a group of 18 healthy male subjects. Under paroxetine, subjects showed significantly decreased activation of the bilateral {NAcc} during processing of primary rewards (erotic videos), but not under bupropion. Similar to the previous study, analysis of psychophysiological interactions revealed that this downregulation relied on negative interactions between left and right {NAcc} {fMRI} signals and the bilateral anteroventral prefrontal cortex that now were significantly enhanced under paroxetine and reduced under bupropion. Individual drug-dependent modulations of interacting brain regions were significantly associated with individual expressions of impulsivity as a personality trait. Our results corroborate and extend previous insights on interregional crosstalk from secondary to primary rewards and demonstrate parallels between active inhibitory control of and serotonergic effects on the dopaminergic reward system's activity.},

	Abstract = {Pursuing an object with smooth eye movements requires an accurate estimate of its two-dimensional ({2D}) trajectory. This {2D} motion computation requires that different local motion measurements are extracted and combined to recover the global object-motion direction and speed. Several combination rules have been proposed such as vector averaging ({VA}), intersection of constraints ({IOC}), or {2D} feature tracking ({2DFT}). To examine this computation, we investigated the time course of smooth pursuit eye movements driven by simple objects of different shapes. For type {II} diamond (where the direction of true object motion is dramatically different from the vector average of the 1-dimensional edge motions, i.e., {VA} ≠ {IOC} = {2DFT}), the ocular tracking is initiated in the vector average direction. Over a period of less than 300 ms, the eye-tracking direction converges on the true object motion. The reduction of the tracking error starts before the closing of the oculomotor loop. For type I diamonds (where the direction of true object motion is identical to the vector average direction, i.e., {VA} = {IOC} = {2DFT}), there is no such bias. We quantified this effect by calculating the direction error between responses to types I and {II} and measuring its maximum value and time constant. At low contrast and high speeds, the initial bias in tracking direction is larger and takes longer to converge onto the actual object-motion direction. This effect is attenuated with the introduction of more {2D} information to the extent that it was totally obliterated with a texture-filled type {II} diamond. These results suggest a flexible {2D} computation for motion integration, which combines all available one-dimensional (edge) and {2D} (feature) motion information to refine the estimate of object-motion direction over time.},

	Abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements reflect the temporal dynamics of bidimensional ({2D}) visual motion integration. When tracking a single, tilted line, initial pursuit direction is biased toward unidimensional ({1D}) edge motion signals, which are orthogonal to the line orientation. Over 200 ms, tracking direction is slowly corrected to finally match the {2D} object motion during steady-state pursuit. We now show that repetition of line orientation and/or motion direction does not eliminate the transient tracking direction error nor change the time course of pursuit correction. Nonetheless, multiple successive presentations of a single orientation/direction condition elicit robust anticipatory pursuit eye movements that always go in the {2D} object motion direction not the {1D} edge motion direction. These results demonstrate that predictive signals about target motion cannot be used for an efficient integration of ambiguous velocity signals at pursuit initiation.},

@article{Castet02,
	Abstract = {Active visual perception relies on the ability to interpret correctly retinal motion signals induced either by moving objects viewed with static eyes or by stationary objects viewed with moving eyes. A motionless environment is not normally perceived as moving during saccadic eye movements. It is commonly believed that this phenomenon involves central oculomotor signals that inhibit intrasaccadic visual motion processing. The keystone of this extraretinal theory relies on experimental reports showing that physically stationary scenes displayed only during saccades, thus producing high retinal velocities, are never perceived as moving but appear as static blurred images. We, however, provide evidence that stimuli optimized for high-speed motion detection elicit clear motion perception against saccade direction, thus making the search for extraretinal suppression superfluous. The data indicate that visual motion is the main cue used by observers to perform the task independently of other perceptual factors covarying with intrasaccadic stimulation. By using stimuli of different durations, we show that the probability of perceiving the stimulus as static, rather than moving, increases when the intrasaccadic stimulation is preceded or followed by a significant extrasaccadic stimulation. We suggest that intrasaccadic motion perception is accomplished by motion-selective magnocellular neurons through temporal integration of rapidly increasing retinal velocities. The functional mechanism that usually prevents this intrasaccadic activity from being perceived seems to rely on temporal masking effects induced by the static retinal images present before and/or after the saccade.},

	Abstract = {The topography of lateral excitatory and lateral inhibitory connections was studied in relation to orientation maps obtained in areas 17 and 18. Small iontophoretic injections of biocytin were delivered to the superficial layers in regions where orientation selectivity had been mapped using electrode recordings of single- and multi-unit activity from various cortical depths. Biocytin revealed extensive patchy axonal projections of up to 3.5 mm in both areas while labelled somata occurred chiefly at the injection site, indicating that the labelling was primarily anterograde. Two types of boutons could be clearly distinguished: (i) putative excitatory boutons either en passant or having a short stalk and (ii) inhibitory boutons which were invariably of the basket-type. Three-dimensional reconstructions of all labelled boutons showed that the excitatory and the inhibitory networks had a distinctively different relationship to orientation maps. The overall distribution of connections showed that 53-59\% of excitatory and 46-48\% of inhibitory connections were at iso-orientation, +/-30 degrees; oblique-orientation, +/-(30-60) degrees, was shown by 30\% of excitatory and 28-39\% of inhibitory connections; cross-orientation was shown by 11-17\% of excitatory and 15-24\% of inhibitory connections. Although excitatory patches occupied mainly iso-orientation locations, interpatch regions representing chiefly non-iso-orientations (oblique + cross orientation) were also innervated. There was considerable overlap between the excitatory and inhibitory network. Nonetheless, inhibitory connections were more common than excitatory connections with non-iso-orientation locations. There was no significant difference between the orientation topography of area 17 and area 18 projections. The results suggest that in general the lateral connectivity system is not orientation specific, but shows a moderate iso-orientation preference for excitation and an even weaker iso-orientation preference for inhibition. The broad orientation spectrum of lateral connections could provide the basis for mechanisms that requiring different orientations, as for example in detecting orientation discontinuities.},

@article{Chumbley12,
	Abstract = {Adaptive behavior often exploits generalizations from past experience by applying them judiciously in new situations. This requires a means of quantifying the relative importance of prior experience and current information, so they can be balanced optimally. In this study, we ask whether the brain generalizes in an optimal way. Specifically, we used Bayesian learning theory and {fMRI} to test whether neuronal responses reflect context-sensitive changes in ambiguity or uncertainty about experience-dependent beliefs. We found that the hippocampus expresses clear ambiguity-dependent responses that are associated with an augmented rate of learning. These findings suggest candidate neuronal systems that may be involved in aberrations of generalization, such as over-confidence. Intelligent behavior requires flexible responses to new situations, which exploit learned principles or abstractions. When no such principles exist, the imperative is to learn quickly from scratch. Behaviorally, we show that subjects learn action-reward relationships in a manner that enables them to generalize rules to new situations. Our {fMRI} results show that when subjects have no evidence that such a rule exists, medial temporal lobe responses (that reflect uncertainty) predict their augmented learning.},

@article{Peyrache12,
	Abstract = {Intracranial recording is an important diagnostic method routinely used in a number of neurological monitoring scenarios. In recent years, advancements in such recordings have been extended to include unit activity of an ensemble of neurons. However, a detailed functional characterization of excitatory and inhibitory cells has not been attempted in human neocortex, particularly during the sleep state. Here, we report that such feature discrimination is possible from high-density recordings in the neocortex by using {2D} multielectrode arrays. Successful separation of regular-spiking neurons (or bursting cells) from fast-spiking cells resulted in well-defined clusters that each showed unique intrinsic firing properties. The high density of the array, which allowed recording from a large number of cells (up to 90), helped us to identify apparent monosynaptic connections, confirming the excitatory and inhibitory nature of regular-spiking and fast-spiking cells, thus categorized as putative pyramidal cells and interneurons, respectively. Finally, we investigated the dynamics of correlations within each class. A marked exponential decay with distance was observed in the case of excitatory but not for inhibitory cells. Although the amplitude of that decline depended on the timescale at which the correlations were computed, the spatial constant did not. Furthermore, this spatial constant is compatible with the typical size of human columnar organization. These findings provide a detailed characterization of neuronal activity, functional connectivity at the microcircuit level, and the interplay of excitation and inhibition in the human neocortex.},

@article{Hunt09,
	Abstract = {Visual activity after eye-opening influences feature map structure in primary visual cortex (V1). For instance, rearing cats in an environment of stripes of one orientation yields an over-representation of that orientation in V1. However, whether such changes also affect the higher-order statistics of orientation maps is unknown. A statistical bias of orientation maps in normally raised animals is that the probability of the angular difference in orientation preference between each pair of points in the cortex depends on the angle of the line joining those points relative to a fixed but arbitrary set of axes. Natural images show an analogous statistical bias; however, whether this drives the development of comparable structure in V1 is unknown. We examined these statistics for normal, stripe-reared and dark-reared cats, and found that the biases present were not consistently related to those present in the input, or to genetic relationships. We compared these results with two computational models of orientation map development, an analytical model and a Hebbian model. The analytical model failed to reproduce the experimentally observed statistics. In the Hebbian model, while orientation difference statistics could be strongly driven by the input, statistics similar to those seen in experimental maps arose only when symmetry breaking was allowed to occur spontaneously. These results suggest that these statistical biases of orientation maps arise primarily spontaneously, rather than being governed by either input statistics or genetic mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {To understand how the human visual system analyzes images, it is essential to know the structure of the visual environment. In particular, natural images display consistent statistical properties that distinguish them from random luminance distributions. We have studied the geometric regularities of oriented elements (edges or line segments) present in an ensemble of visual scenes, asking how much information the presence of a segment in a particular location of the visual scene carries about the presence of a second segment at different relative positions and orientations. We observed strong long-range correlations in the distribution of oriented segments that extend over the whole visual field. We further show that a very simple geometric rule, cocircularity, predicts the arrangement of segments in natural scenes, and that different geometrical arrangements show relevant differences in their scaling properties. Our results show similarities to geometric features of previous physiological and psychophysical studies. We discuss the implications of these findings for theories of early vision.},

@article{Hunt11,
	Abstract = {The statistical structure of the visual world offers many useful clues for understanding how biological visual systems may understand natural scenes. One particularly important early process in visual object recognition is that of grouping together edges which belong to the same contour. The layout of edges in natural scenes have strong statistical structure. One such statistical property is that edges tend to lie on a common circle, and this 'co-circularity' can predict human performance at contour grouping. We therefore tested the hypothesis that long-range excitatory lateral connections in the primary visual cortex, which are believed to be involved in contour grouping, display a similar co-circular structure. By analyzing data from tree shrews, where information on both lateral connectivity and the overall structure of the orientation map was available, we found a surprising diversity in the relevant statistical structure of the connections. In particular, the extent to which co-circularity was displayed varied significantly. Overall, these data suggest the intriguing possibility that V1 may contain both co-circular and anti-cocircular connections.},

@article{Finn07,
	Abstract = {Simple cells in primary visual cortex exhibit contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in seeming contradiction to feed-forward models that rely on lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) input alone. Contrast invariance has therefore been thought to depend on the presence of intracortical lateral inhibition. In vivo intracellular recordings instead suggest that contrast invariance can be explained by three properties of the excitatory pathway. (1) Depolarizations evoked by orthogonal stimuli are determined by the amount of excitation a cell receives from the {LGN}, relative to the excitation it receives from other cortical cells. (2) Depolarizations evoked by preferred stimuli saturate at lower contrasts than the spike output of {LGN} relay cells. (3) Visual stimuli evoke contrast-dependent changes in trial-to-trial variability, which lead to contrast-dependent changes in the relationship between membrane potential and spike rate. Thus, high-contrast, orthogonally oriented stimuli that evoke significant depolarizations evoke few spikes. Together these mechanisms, without lateral inhibition, can account for contrast-invariant stimulus selectivity.},

@article{Wichmann10,
	Abstract = {S. J. Thorpe, D. Fize, and C. Marlot () showed how rapidly observers can detect animals in images of natural scenes, but it is still unclear which image features support this rapid detection. A. B. Torralba and A. Oliva () suggested that a simple image statistic based on the power spectrum allows the absence or presence of objects in natural scenes to be predicted. We tested whether human observers make use of power spectral differences between image categories when detecting animals in natural scenes. In and we found performance to be essentially independent of the power spectrum. Computational analysis revealed that the ease of classification correlates with the proposed spectral cue without being caused by it. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that in commercial stock photo databases a majority of animal images are pre-segmented from the background by the photographers and this pre-segmentation causes the power spectral differences between image categories and may, furthermore, help rapid animal detection. Data from a third experiment are consistent with this hypothesis. Together, our results make it exceedingly unlikely that human observers make use of power spectral differences between animal- and no-animal images during rapid animal detection. In addition, our results point to potential confounds in the commercially available \^{a}? natural image\^{a}? databases whose statistics may be less natural than commonly presumed.},

@article{Drewes11a,
	Abstract = {Motor reaction times in humans are highly variable from one trial to the next, even for simple and automatic tasks, such as shifting your gaze to a suddenly appearing target. Although classic models of reaction time generation consider this variability to reflect intrinsic noise, some portion of it could also be attributed to ongoing neuronal processes. For example, variations of alpha rhythm frequency (8--12 Hz) across individuals, or alpha amplitude across trials, have been related previously to manual reaction time variability. Here we investigate the trial-by-trial influence of oscillatory phase, a dynamic marker of ongoing activity, on saccadic reaction time in three paradigms of increasing cognitive demand (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, and visual discrimination tasks). The phase of ongoing prestimulus activity in the high alpha/low beta range (11--17 Hz) at frontocentral locations was strongly associated with saccadic response latencies. This relation, present in all three paradigms, peaked for phases recorded ∼50 ms before fixation point offset and 250 ms before target onset. Reaction times in the most demanding discrimination task fell into two distinct modes reflecting a fast but inaccurate strategy or a slow and efficient one. The phase effect was markedly stronger in the group of subjects using the faster strategy. We conclude that periodic fluctuations of electrical activity attributable to neuronal oscillations can modulate the efficiency of the oculomotor system on a rapid timescale; however, this relation may be obscured when cognitive load also adds a significant contribution to response time variability.},

@article{Johnston06,
	Abstract = {A fundamental question about the perception of time is whether the neural mechanisms underlying temporal judgements are universal and centralized in the brain or modality specific and distributed. Time perception has traditionally been thought to be entirely dissociated from spatial vision. Here we show that the apparent duration of a dynamic stimulus can be manipulated in a local region of visual space by adapting to oscillatory motion or flicker. This implicates spatially localized temporal mechanisms in duration perception. We do not see concomitant changes in the time of onset or offset of the test patterns, demonstrating a direct local effect on duration perception rather than an indirect effect on the time course of neural processing. The effects of adaptation on duration perception can also be dissociated from motion or flicker perception per se. Although 20 Hz adaptation reduces both the apparent temporal frequency and duration of a 10 Hz test stimulus, 5 Hz adaptation increases apparent temporal frequency but has little effect on duration perception. We conclude that there is a peripheral, spatially localized, essentially visual component involved in sensing the duration of visual events.},

Hippocampal neurons also differentially encode the key events and disambiguate different event sequences to compose unique, temporally organized representations of specific experiences.

	Abstract = {Some insects use optic flow ({OF}) to perform their navigational tasks perfectly. Learning from insects' {OF} navigation strategies, this article proposes a bio-inspired integrated navigation system based on {OF}. The integrated navigation system is composed of an {OF} navigation system ({OFNS}) and an {OF} aided navigation system ({OFAN}). The {OFNS} uses a simple {OF} method to measure motion at each step along a path. The position information is then obtained by path integration. However, path integration leads to cumulative position errors which increase rapidly with time. To overcome this problem, the {OFAN} is employed to assist the {OFNS} in estimating and correcting these cumulative errors. The {OFAN} adopts an {OF}-based Kalman filter ({KF}) to continuously estimate the position errors. Moreover, based on the {OF} technique used in the {OFNS}, we develop a new {OF} method employed by the {OFAN} to generate the measurement input of the {OF}-based {KF}. As a result, both the {OFNS} and the {OFAN} in our integrated navigation system are derived from the same {OF} method so that they share input signals and some operations. The proposed integrated navigation system can provide accurate position information without interference from cumulative errors yet doing so with low computational effort. Simulations and comparisons have demonstrated its efficiency.},

	Abstract = {Waves are common in cortical networks and may be important for carrying information about a stimulus from one local circuit to another. In a recent study of visually evoked waves in rat cortex, compression and reflection of waves are observed as the activation passes from visual areas V1 to V2. The authors of this study apply bicuculline ({BMI}) and demonstrate that the reflection disappears. They conclude that inhibition plays a major role in compression and reflection. We present several models for propagating waves in heterogeneous media and show that the velocity and thus compression depends weakly on inhibition. We propose that the main site of action of {BMI} with respect to wave propagation is on the threshold for firing which we suggest is related to action on potassium channels. We combine numerical and analytic methods to explore both compression and reflection in an excitable system with synaptic coupling.},

	Abstract = {An experiment about inattention blindness was conducted within the context of an art exhibition as opposed to a laboratory context in order to investigate the potential of art as a vehicle to study attention and its disorders. The project utilized a flash animation, Stealing Attention, that was modeled after the movie by Simons and Chabris (1999) but with significant experimental differences, involving context and staging, the emotional salience of the objects depicted, and the prior art viewing experience of participants. The study involved two components: observing if viewers watching an animation in a gallery could be distracted from noticing the disappearance of stolen museum antiquities (the targets) by the overlaid flashing images of a card game (the distractors) and then observing whether repetition of the depicted targets throughout the gallery installation could facilitate a re-direction of attention that allowed viewers to perceive the targets not initially noted in the animation. My findings were that, after viewing the entire installation and then re-viewing the animation, 64\% of the viewers who did not initially remark on the targets in the animation were then able to see them. The discussion elaborates on these findings and then considers ways in which the implications of inattention blindness paradigms might be more fully rendered by uniting insights from the two disciplines of art and neuroscience than by either alone.},

@article{Perdreau11,
	Abstract = {Our perception starts with the image that falls on our retina and on this retinal image, distant objects are small and shadowed surfaces are dark. But this is not what we see. Visual constancies correct for distance so that, for example, a person approaching us does not appear to become a larger person. Interestingly, an artist, when rendering a scene realistically, must undo all these corrections, making distant objects again small. To determine whether years of art training and practice have conferred any specialized visual expertise, we compared the perceptual abilities of artists to those of non-artists in three tasks. We first asked them to adjust either the size or the brightness of a target to match it to a standard that was presented on a perspective grid or within a cast shadow. We instructed them to ignore the context, judging size, for example, by imagining the separation between their fingers if they were to pick up the test object from the display screen. In the third task, we tested the speed with which artists access visual representations. Subjects searched for an L-shape in contact with a circle; the target was an L-shape, but because of visual completion, it appeared to be a square occluded behind a circle, camouflaging the L-shape that is explicit on the retinal image. Surprisingly, artists were as affected by context as non-artists in all three tests. Moreover, artists took, on average, significantly more time to make their judgments, implying that they were doing their best to demonstrate the special skills that we, and they, believed they had acquired. Our data therefore support the proposal from Gombrich that artists do not have special perceptual expertise to undo the effects of constancies. Instead, once the context is present in their drawing, they need only compare the drawing to the scene to match the effect of constancies in both.},

	Abstract = {Levels of ecological sounds vary over several orders of magnitude, but the firing rate and membrane potential of a neuron are much more limited in range. In binaural neurons of the barn owl, tuning to interaural delays is independent of level differences. Yet a monaural neuron with a fixed threshold should fire earlier in response to louder sounds, which would disrupt the tuning of these neurons. How could spike timing be independent of input level? Here I derive theoretical conditions for a spiking model to be insensitive to input level. The key property is a dynamic change in spike threshold. I then show how level invariance can be physiologically implemented, with specific ionic channel properties. It appears that these ingredients are indeed present in monaural neurons of the sound localization pathway of birds and mammals.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic neuronal networks are a key paradigm of increasing importance in brain research, concerned with the functional analysis of biological neuronal networks and, at the same time, with the synthesis of artificial brain-like systems. In this context, neuronal network models serve as mathematical tools to understand the function of brains, but they might as well develop into future tools for enhancing certain functions of our nervous system. Here, we present and discuss our recent achievements in developing multiplicative point processes into a viable mathematical framework for spiking network modeling. The perspective is that the dynamic behavior of these neuronal networks is faithfully reflected by a set of non-linear rate equations, describing all interactions on the population level. These equations are similar in structure to {Lotka-Volterra} equations, well known by their use in modeling predator-prey relations in population biology, but abundant applications to economic theory have also been described. We present a number of biologically relevant examples for spiking network function, which can be studied with the help of the aforementioned correspondence between spike trains and specific systems of non-linear coupled ordinary differential equations. We claim that, enabled by the use of multiplicative point processes, we can make essential contributions to a more thorough understanding of the dynamical properties of interacting neuronal populations.},

	Abstract = {Accurate timing is an integral aspect of sensory and motor processes such as the perception of speech and music and the execution of skilled movement. Neuropsychological studies of time perception in patient groups and functional neuroimaging studies of timing in normal participants suggest common neural substrates for perceptual and motor timing. A timing system is implicated in core regions of the motor network such as the cerebellum, inferior olive, basal ganglia, pre-supplementary, and supplementary motor area, pre-motor cortex as well as higher-level areas such as the prefrontal cortex. In this article, we assess how distinct parts of the timing system subserve different aspects of perceptual timing. We previously established brain bases for absolute, duration-based timing and relative, beat-based timing in the olivocerebellar and striato-thalamo-cortical circuits respectively (Teki et al., 2011). However, neurophysiological and neuroanatomical studies provide a basis to suggest that timing functions of these circuits may not be independent. Here, we propose a unified model of time perception based on coordinated activity in the core striatal and olivocerebellar networks that are interconnected with each other and the cerebral cortex through multiple synaptic pathways. Timing in this unified model is proposed to involve serial beat-based striatal activation followed by absolute olivocerebellar timing mechanisms.},

	Abstract = {Many redundancies play functional roles in motor control and motor learning. For example, kinematic and muscle redundancies contribute to stabilizing posture and impedance control, respectively. Another redundancy is the number of neurons themselves; there are overwhelmingly more neurons than muscles, and many combinations of neural activation can generate identical muscle activity. The functional roles of this neuronal redundancy remains unknown. Analysis of a redundant neural network model makes it possible to investigate these functional roles while varying the number of model neurons and holding constant the number of output units. Our analysis reveals that learning speed reaches its maximum value if and only if the model includes sufficient neuronal redundancy. This analytical result does not depend on whether the distribution of the preferred direction is uniform or a skewed bimodal, both of which have been reported in neurophysiological studies. Neuronal redundancy maximizes learning speed, even if the neural network model includes recurrent connections, a nonlinear activation function, or nonlinear muscle units. Furthermore, our results do not rely on the shape of the generalization function. The results of this study suggest that one of the functional roles of neuronal redundancy is to maximize learning speed. There are overwhelmingly more neurons than muscles in the motor system. The functional roles of this neuronal redundancy remains unknown. Our analysis, which uses a redundant neural network model, reveals that learning speed reaches its maximum value if and only if the model includes sufficient neuronal redundancy.

We have confirmed that our results are consistent, regardless of whether the model includes recurrent connections, a nonlinear activation function, or nonlinear muscle units. Additionally, our results are the same when using either a broad or a narrow generalization function. These results suggest that one of the functional roles of neuronal redundancy is to maximize learning speed.},

@article{Fetsch12,
	Abstract = {
                Integration of multiple sensory cues is essential for precise and accurate perception and behavioral performance, yet the reliability of sensory signals can vary across modalities and viewing conditions. Human observers typically employ the optimal strategy of weighting each cue in proportion to its reliability, but the neural basis of this computation remains poorly understood. We trained monkeys to perform a heading discrimination task from visual and vestibular cues, varying cue reliability randomly. The monkeys appropriately placed greater weight on the more reliable cue, and population decoding of neural responses in the dorsal medial superior temporal area closely predicted behavioral cue weighting, including modest deviations from optimality. We found that the mathematical combination of visual and vestibular inputs by single neurons is generally consistent with recent theories of optimal probabilistic computation in neural circuits. These results provide direct evidence for a neural mechanism mediating a simple and widespread form of statistical inference.

@article{Holzman00,
	Abstract = {Clinical Schizophrenia has eluded precise description because of its protean phenotypic manifestations and variable clinical course, a variability that also makes it difficult to discover genetic linkages. Co-familial traits have higher recurrence risk rates than schizophrenia itself and might serve as pointers to the underlying physiology of schizophrenic illness. A dysfunction of smooth pursuit eye movements is one such co-familial trait that occurs in about 40 to 80\% of schizophrenic patients and about 25 to 40\% of their first degree relatives. The eye movement abnormality appears only when the subject tracks a moving target. We have traced this abnormality to a deficit in velocity sensitivity, a function that is regulated by a specific central nervous system network that includes the middle temporal and medial superior temporal areas of the extra-striate cortex. The higher familial recurrence risk of abnormal eye tracking, compared with that of clinical schizophrenia (about 5 to 8\%), suggests that schizophrenic psychosis may be the rare form of a more prevalent disorder whose symptoms are much milder and more benign than the cognitive and behavioral disturbances of the clinical psychosis. From this vantage point, abnormal eye tracking can be viewed as one pleiotropic manifestation of schizophrenia, considered broadly, just as the caf\'{e}-au-lait spots of neurofibromatosis are a more benign and more frequent manifestation of that disease than are the neurofibromata.},

@article{Bennett07,
	Abstract = {Given sufficient exposure to stimulus presentation, the oculomotor system generates a representation of the stimulus characteristics, which is then used to predict the upcoming target motion. In addition to compensating for the perceptual-motor delay, these predictive processes perpetuate eye motion during a transient occlusion and compensate for the loss of visual input. At present, however, it is not well understood whether and how the oculomotor system extracts and represents target acceleration for subsequent predictive control. To this end, we used a target occlusion paradigm where both position and velocity of the target during the occlusion and at reappearance could not be predicted without extracting target acceleration before target disappearance. We found that the oculomotor response during the blanking period was not influenced by target acceleration when the initial exposure was 200 ms. However, smooth and saccadic eye movements did discriminate between the different levels of acceleration after an initial 500- or 800-ms exposure. In the event that the smooth response during the occlusion did not match well the target trajectory and thus eliminate a developing displacement error, there was an increased saccadic displacement. Still, the combined response during the blanking period did not eliminate retinal slip and position error at target reappearance. These results indicate that information on target acceleration can be extracted on-line, during pursuit of a visible ramp, and then used to drive a predictive oculomotor response in the absence of visual input.},

	Abstract = {The link between anticipatory smooth eye movements and prediction in sinusoidal pursuit was investigated by presentation of series of identical, single-cycle, sinusoidal target motion stimuli. Stimuli occurred at randomized intervals (1.2-2.8 s) but were preceded by an audio warning cue 480 ms before each presentation. Cycle period (T) varied from 0.64 to 2.56 s and target displacement from 4 to 20 degrees in separate series. For T </= 1.28 s, responses to the first stimulus of each series exhibited a time delay across the whole cycle (mean = 121 ms for T = 0.8 s). But, in the second and subsequent (steady-state) presentations, anticipatory movements, proportional to target velocity, were made and time delay was significantly reduced (mean = 43 ms for T = 0.8 s). Steady-state time delays were comparable to those evoked during continuous sinusoidal pursuit and less than pursuit reaction time. Even when subjects did not follow the target in the first presentation, they responded to the second presentation with reduced time delay. Throughout the experiments, three types of catch trial ({A-C}) were introduced. In A, the target failed to appear as expected after the warning cue. Anticipatory smooth movements were initiated, reaching a peak velocity proportional to prior target velocity around 200 ms after expected target onset. In B, the target stopped midway through the cycle. Even if the target remained on and was stationary, the eye movement continued to be driven away from the stationary target with a velocity similar to that of prior responses, reaching a peak velocity that was again proportional to expected target velocity after >/=205 ms. In C, the amplitude of the single sinusoid was unexpectedly increased or decreased. When it decreased, eye velocity throughout the first half-cycle of the response was close to that executed in response to prior stimuli of higher velocity and did not return to an appropriate level for 382-549 ms. Conversely, when amplitude increased, eye velocity remained inappropriately low for the first half-cycle. Results of A and C indicate that subjects are able to use velocity information stored from prior presentations to initiate an oculomotor drive that predominates over visual feedback for the first half-cycle. Results of B indicate that the second part of the cycle is also preprogrammed because it continued despite efforts to suppress it by fixation. The results suggest that initial retinal velocity error information can be sampled, stored, and subsequently replayed as a bi-directional anticipatory pattern of movement that reduces temporal delay and could account for predictive control during sinusoidal pursuit.},

The brain's structural and functional systems have features of complex networks --- such as small-world topology, highly connected hubs and modularity --- both at the whole-brain scale of human neuroimaging and at a cellular scale in non-human animals. In this article, we review studies investigating complex brain networks in diverse experimental modalities (including structural and functional {MRI}, diffusion tensor imaging, magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography in humans) and provide an accessible introduction to the basic principles of graph theory.

@article{Miles86,
	Abstract = {The ocular following responses elicited by brief unexpected movements of the visual scene were studied in 10 rhesus monkeys. Test patterns were either random dots or sine-wave gratings [spatial frequency (Fs) 0.046-1.06 cycles per degree (c/degree)]. Test stimuli were velocity steps [speed (V) 5-400 degrees/s] of 100-ms duration, applied 50 ms after spontaneous saccades to avoid saccadic intrusions. Eye velocity response profiles were nonmonotonic and idiosyncratic, but consistent and closely time-locked to stimulus onset. Two measures of response amplitude were used: initial peak in eye velocity (ei), and average final eye velocity over the period of 110-140 ms measured from stimulus onset (ef). Using random dot patterns, response latencies were short, e.g., when the criterion for onset was an eye acceleration of 100 degrees/s2, mean latency (+/- {SE}) for eight monkeys with a 40 degrees/s test ramp was 51.5 +/- 0.6 ms. Using gratings of low spatial frequency (Fs less than 0.5 c/degree), latency was inversely related to, and solely a function of, contrast and temporal frequency, Ft (where Ft = V X Fs). We conclude from the latter that ocular following is triggered by local changes in luminance, and propose a model of the detection mechanism that reproduces all the essential features of these data. Moderate low-pass spatial filtering ("blurring") of the random dot pattern, by interposing a sheet of ground glass between the animal and the scene, progressively increased the response latency and decreased ef, but ei was either little affected or increased. When used with gratings, the ground glass simply reduced the contrast (range: 0.5-0.003), with very similar consequences for ocular following: latency increased and ef decreased, but ei changed little over the first decade of contrast reduction, increased over the second, and began to show attenuation (often pronounced) only at the lowest contrast. We suggest that these anomalous increases in ei with reductions in contrast are secondary to the delay in response onset and might be explained if the motion detectors responsible for triggering ocular following act as a gate for integrated retinal slip inputs to the tracking system proper: the delay in detection causes a buildup in the error signal driving the tracking response. En masse movement of the visual field was not the optimal stimulus for ocular {following.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Wu11a,
	Abstract = {The visual system is thought to represent the direction of moving objects in the relative activity of large populations of cortical neurons that are broadly tuned to the direction of stimulus motion, but how changes in the direction of a moving stimulus are represented in the population response remains poorly understood. Here we take advantage of the orderly mapping of direction selectivity in ferret primary visual cortex (V1) to explore how abrupt changes in the direction of a moving stimulus are encoded in population activity using voltage-sensitive dye imaging. For stimuli moving in a constant direction, the peak of the V1 population response accurately represented the direction of stimulus motion, but following abrupt changes in motion direction, the peak transiently departed from the direction of stimulus motion in a fashion that varied with the direction offset angle and was well predicted from the response to the component directions. We conclude that cortical dynamics and population coding mechanisms combine to place constraints on the accuracy with which abrupt changes in direction of motion can be represented by cortical circuits.},

	Abstract = {Background. Previous studies of oculomotor dysfunction in schizophrenia have tended to concentrate on abnormalities of smooth pursuit eye tracking in chronic medicated patients. We report the results of a study of smooth pursuit, reflexive and antisaccade performance in drug naive and antipsychotic treated first-episode schizophrenic {patients.Methods}. Smooth pursuit and saccadic eye movements were recorded in 36 first-episode schizophrenic patients and 36 controls matched for age and estimated {IQ}. The schizophrenic patients were divided into drug-naive (N=17) and antipsychotic treated groups ({N=19).Results}. Smooth pursuit velocity gain was significantly lower than controls only in the drug-naive patients. The treated patients did not differ significantly from either the controls or the untreated group. In an antisaccade paradigm both treated and drug-naive schizophrenic patients demonstrated an increased number of errors, but only drug-naive patients also demonstrated an increased latency in initiating correct {antisaccades.Conclusions}. These impairments are unlikely to be due to a generalized deficit in oculomotor function in the schizophrenic groups, as there were no differences between the groups in saccadic metrics on a reflexive saccade task. The results show that both smooth pursuit and saccadic abnormalities are present at the onset of schizophrenia and are integral to the disorder.},

@article{Schwartz99,
	Abstract = {Early information processing deficits are consistently reported for patients with schizophrenia on smooth pursuit tracking tasks. A growing number of studies have applied a transient (magnocellular) or sustained (parvocellular) explanation to account for deficient processing of briefly presented visual stimuli, moving stimuli, and particularly, stimuli requiring smooth tracking eye movements in patients with schizophrenia. Although the preponderance of findings offer support for transient (where is it?) as opposed to sustained (what is it?) deficit, a need remains for specific depiction of the deficit. This was accomplished by applying a unique analytic method to a smooth pursuit tracking task. Fourteen patients with schizophrenia and fifteen normal control subjects were tested on smooth pursuit tracking performance at five different "within-wave" dot velocity frequencies that ranged from .3 to 1.1 hz. Performance data was extracted from each of the five frequencies and then separated into 12 discrete components that corresponded to light velocity (i.e., 12 bins). A repeated measures multivariate analysis of covariance indicated that the performance of patients with schizophrenia was significantly poorer than that of their normal counterparts for three separate analyses of the time in smooth pursuit, F(11,594) = 8.99; p <0.00001, percentage of time in smooth pursuit, F(11,594) = 3.06; p <0.0005, and time in saccade eye movement, F(11,594) = 3.11; p <0.0004. A regression analysis revealed that the medication dosage was not significantly associated with performance on any of the critical measures, although trends were observed. The findings provide support for an early information processing deficit in patients with schizophrenia. In addition, the results support the current neurophysiologic model for abnormal smooth pursuit tracking in patients with schizophrenia, specifically implicating a transient channel deficiency.},

@article{Avila06,
	Abstract = {Schizophrenia patients exhibit several smooth pursuit abnormalities including poor pursuit initiation. Velocity discrimination is also impaired and is correlated with pursuit initiation performance-suggesting that pursuit deficits are related to impairments in processing velocity information. Studies suggest that pursuit initiation is influenced by prior target motion information and/or expectations and that this is likely caused by expectation-based changes in the perceptual inputs to the pursuit system. We examined whether poor pursuit initiation in schizophrenia results from inaccurate encoding of immediate velocity signals, or whether these deficits reflect a failure to use prior target motion information to "optimize" the response. Twenty-eight patients and 24 controls performed an adapted version of a "remembered pursuit task." Trials consisted of a series of target motions, the first of which occurred unexpectedly, followed by four to seven identical targets each preceded by an auditory cue and a "catch target" in which a cue was given followed by target extinction. Initiation eye velocity in response to unexpected, first targets was similar in the patient and control groups. In contrast, patients showed lower eye velocity in response to repeated, cued targets compared with controls. Patients also showed reduced eye velocity in response to catch targets. Reduction in pursuit latency across repeated targets was less robust in patients. Results suggest that processing of immediate velocity information is unaffected in schizophrenia and that pursuit initiation deficits reflect an inability to accurately generate, store, and/or access "remembered" velocity signals.},

@article{Florack92,
	Abstract = {Why and how one should study a scale-space is prescribed by the universal physical law of scale invariance, expressed by the so-called Pi-theorem. The fact that any image is a physical observable with an inner and outer scale bound, necessarily gives rise to a 'scale-space representation', in which a given image is represented by a one-dimensional family of images representing that image on various levels of inner spatial scale. An early vision system is completely ignorant of the geometry of its input. Its primary task is to establish this geometry at any available scale. The absence of geometrical knowledge poses additional constraints on the construction of a scale-space, notably linearity, spatial shift invariance and isotropy, thereby defining a complete hierarchical family of scaled partial differential operators: the Gaussian kernel (the lowest order, resettling operator) and its linear partial derivatives. They enable local image analysis through the detection of local differential structure in a robust way, while at the same time capturing global features through the extra scale degree of freedom. In this paper we show why the operations of scaling and differentiation cannot be separated. This framework permits us to construct in a systematic way multiscale, cartesian differential invariants, i.e. true image descriptors that exhibit manifest invariance with respect to a change of cartesian coordinates. The scale-space operators closely resemble the receptive field profiles found in mammalian frontend visual systems.},

@article{Mowafy90,
	Abstract = {When viewing a pair of bars defined by the difference of spatial Gaussian functions ({DOGs}), human observers can discriminate accurately the relative movements of the bars, even when they differ in spatial frequency. On each trial, observers viewed two brief presentation intervals in which a pair of vertically oriented {DOGs} moved randomly back and forth within a restricted range. During one interval, both bars moved in the same horizontal direction and by the same magnitude (correlated movements); in the other interval, their movements were uncorrelated. When discrimination accuracy is related to the simultaneous detection of two independent movements, it was found that, if observers can detect the movements of spatially separated bars, they can tell whether their relative movements arecorrelated. Performance remained remarkably accurate even when the two bars differed in spatial frequency by more than two octaves or were presented separately to the two eyes. Apparently, the accurate discrimination of coherent motion involves an efficient spatial integration of optical motion information over multiple spatial locations and multiple spatial scales.},

@article{Mowafy92,
	Abstract = {When observers view the relative movements of a pair of bars defined by the difference of spatial Gaussian functions ({DOGs}), they can accurately discriminate coherent movements over a range of temporal frequencies and temporal asynchronies. Of particular interest is the fact that performance accuracy is maintained even when the two bars differ in spatial-frequency content and contrast. On each trial, observers viewed two brief presentation intervals in which a pair of vertically oriented {DOGs} moved randomly back and forth within a restricted range. During one observation interval, both elements moved in the same direction and by the same magnitude (correlated), and in the other interval, the movements were independent (uncorrelated). Temporal asynchronies were introduced by delaying the displacement of the right bar relative to that of the left bar in each interval. Observers were able to discriminate correlated versus uncorrelated movements up to a 45--60-msec temporal delay between the two elements' relative displacements. If motion processing is accomplished by mechanisms operating over multiple spatial and temporal scales, the visual system's tolerance of temporal delays among correlated signals may facilitate their space-time integration, thereby capitalizing on the perceptual utility of coherent-motion information for image segmentation and interpolating surface structure from the movements of spatially separated features.},

@article{Lindeberg11,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a generalized axiomatic scale-space theory that makes it possible to derive the notions of linear scale-space, affine Gaussian scale-space and linear spatio-temporal scale-space using a similar set of assumptions (scale-space axioms). The notion of non-enhancement of local extrema is generalized from previous application over discrete and rotationally symmetric kernels to continuous and more general non-isotropic kernels over both spatial and spatio-temporal image domains. It is shown how a complete classification can be given of the linear (Gaussian) scale-space concepts that satisfy these conditions on isotropic spatial, non-isotropic spatial and spatio-temporal domains, which results in a general taxonomy of Gaussian scale-spaces for continuous image data. The resulting theory allows filter shapes to be tuned from specific context information and provides a theoretical foundation for the recently exploited mechanisms of shape adaptation and velocity adaptation, with highly useful applications in computer vision. It is also shown how time-causal spatio-temporal scale-spaces can be derived from similar assumptions. The mathematical structure of these scale-spaces is analyzed in detail concerning transformation properties over space and time, the temporal cascade structure they satisfy over time as well as properties of the resulting multi-scale spatio-temporal derivative operators. It is also shown how temporal derivatives with respect to transformed time can be defined, leading to the formulation of a novel analogue of scale normalized derivatives for time-causal scale-spaces. The kernels generated from these two types of theories have interesting relations to biological vision. We show how filter kernels generated from the Gaussian spatio-temporal scale-space as well as the time-causal spatio-temporal scale-space relate to spatio-temporal receptive field profiles registered from mammalian vision. Specifically, we show that there are close analogies to space-time separable cells in the {LGN} as well as to both space-time separable and non-separable cells in the striate cortex. We do also present a set of plausible models for complex cells using extended quasi-quadrature measures expressed in terms of scale normalized spatio-temporal derivatives. The theories presented as well as their relations to biological vision show that it is possible to describe a general set of Gaussian and/or time-causal scale-spaces using a unified framework, which generalizes and complements previously presented scale-space formulations in this area.},

@article{Burger07,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we consider error estimation for image restoration problems based on generalized Bregman distances. This error estimation technique has been used to derive convergence rates of variational regularization schemes for linear and nonlinear inverse problems by the authors before (cf. Burger in Inverse Prob 20: 1411--1421, 2004; Resmerita in Inverse Prob 21: 1303--1314, 2005; Inverse Prob 22: 801--814, 2006), but so far it was not applied to image restoration in a systematic way. Due to the flexibility of the Bregman distances, this approach is particularly attractive for imaging tasks, where often singular energies (non-differentiable, not strictly convex) are used to achieve certain tasks such as preservation of edges. Besides the discussion of the variational image restoration schemes, our main goal in this paper is to extend the error estimation approach to iterative regularization schemes (and time-continuous flows) that have emerged recently as multiscale restoration techniques and could improve some shortcomings of the variational schemes. We derive error estimates between the iterates and the exact image both in the case of clean and noisy data, the latter also giving indications on the choice of termination criteria. The error estimates are applied to various image restoration approaches such as denoising and decomposition by total variation and wavelet methods. We shall see that interesting results for various restoration approaches can be deduced from our general results by just exploring the structure of subgradients.},

@article{Johnston95,
	Abstract = {The paper examines the perception of motion in contrast-modulated sine-wave grating patterns. These non-rigid motion patterns give rise to a spatially-structured motion percept in which perceived speed varies with spatial position. We measured the perceived motion of the low contrast regions of amplitude-modulated gratings as a function of the carrier frequency, the carrier speed, the shape of the modulation signal and the modulation depth. We found that for the static carriers perceived speed was greatest in the low contrast regions of the display. The speed of the low contrast regions was underestimated and perceived speed decreased as the spatial frequency of the carrier increased. When the direction of the motion of the carrier was opposite to that of the contrast modulation, the low contrast regions could appear to be stationary. The perceived speed of the contrast modulation increased with modulation depth. The brightness contrast of the carrier grating had little effect on perceived speed of contrast-modulated patterns for average contrasts of over 10\%. A motion model which had full-wave rectification as an explicit pre-processing stage followed by low-pass filtering or some other selection criterion, would predict that the motion of contrast-modulated gratings should appear rigid and that the motion of the envelope should be judged correctly. The Multi-channel Gradient Model however predicts both the structured motion field experienced when viewing these second-order motion patterns and the reductions in perceived speed as a function of carrier spatial frequency and carrier speed.},

We argue that such a temporal scale space should possess the properties of: temporal causality, linearity, continuity, positivity, recursitivity as well as translational and scaling covariance. It is shown that these requirements imply a one parameter family of convolution kernels. Furthermore it is shown that these measurements can be realized in a time recursive way, with the current data as input and the temporal scale space as state, i.e. there is no need for storing earlier input. This family of measurement processes contains the diffusion equation on the half line (that represents the temporal scale) with the input signal as boundary condition on the temporal axis. The diffusion equation is unique among the measurement processes in the sense that it is preserves positivity (in the scale domain) and is infinitesimally generated. A numerical scheme is developed and relations to other approaches are discussed.},

We show that these properties taken together constrain the structure of receptive fields to a very large degree. Only those field structures that arise as solutions of a certain linear partial differential equation of the second order prove to satisfy these general constraints. The equation admits of complete, orthonormal families of solutions. These families have to be regarded as the possible receptive field families subject to certain symmetry conditions. They can be transformed into each other via unitary transformations. Thus a single representation suffices to construct all the others. This theory permits us to classify the possible linear receptive field structures exhaustively, and to define their internal and external interrelations.

However, recent work reveals that the genital representation in {SI} for cutaneous sensations (as opposed to tumescence) is continuous with that of the lower trunk and thigh. This result, in conjunction with reports of separate face innervation and its earlier onset of sensory function, compared to that of the rest of the body, allows a reappraisal of homuncular organization. It is proposed that the somatosensory homunculus comprises two distinct somatotopic regions: the face representation and that of the rest of the body. Principles of self-organization do not account satisfactorily for the overall homuncular map. These results may serve to alert computational modelers that intrinsic developmental factors can override simple rules of plasticity.},

@article{Gershman12,
	Abstract = {Ambiguous images present a challenge to the visual system: How can uncertainty about the causes of visual inputs be represented when there are multiple equally plausible causes? A Bayesian ideal observer should represent uncertainty in the form of a posterior probability distribution over causes. However, in many real-world situations, computing this distribution is intractable and requires some form of approximation. We argue that the visual system approximates the posterior over underlying causes with a set of samples and that this approximation strategy produces perceptual multistability?stochastic alternation between percepts in consciousness. Under our analysis, multistability arises from a dynamic sample-generating process that explores the posterior through stochastic diffusion, implementing a rational form of approximate Bayesian inference known as Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}). We examine in detail the most extensively studied form of multistability, binocular rivalry, showing how a variety of experimental phenomena?gamma-like stochastic switching, patchy percepts, fusion, and traveling waves?can be understood in terms of {MCMC} sampling over simple graphical models of the underlying perceptual tasks. We conjecture that the stochastic nature of spiking neurons may lend itself to implementing sample-based posterior approximations in the brain.},

In the experiments, {DPCNN} has been well tested by using Brodatz's album and the {VisTex} database. Several existing models are compared with the proposed {DPCNN} model. The experimental results, based on different testing data sets for images with different translations, orientations, scales, and affine transformations, show that our proposed model outperforms existing models in geometry-invariant texture retrieval.

	Abstract = {In this study, we assume that the brain uses a general-purpose pattern generator to transform static commands into basic movement segments. We hypothesize that this pattern generator includes an oscillator whose complete cycle generates a single movement segment. In order to demonstrate this hypothesis, we construct an oscillator-based model of movement generation. The model includes an oscillator that generates harmonic outputs whose frequency and amplitudes can be modulated by external inputs. The harmonic outputs drive a number of integrators, each activating a single muscle. The model generates muscle activation patterns composed of rectilinear and harmonic terms. We show that rectilinear and fundamental harmonic terms account for known properties of natural movements, such as the invariant bell-shaped hand velocity profile during reaching. We implement these dynamics by a neural network model and characterize the tuning properties of the neural integrator cells, the neural oscillator cells, and the inputs to the system. Finally, we propose a method to test our hypothesis that a neural oscillator is a central component in the generation of voluntary movement.},

However, our model is more general as it can also explain a variety of other top-down processes in vision, such as figure/ground segmentation and contextual cueing. This model thus suggests that a common mechanism, involving cortical feedback pathways, is responsible for a range of phenomena and provides a unified account of currently disparate areas of research.},

	Abstract = {The role of dopamine in behaviour and decision-making is often cast in terms of reinforcement learning and optimal decision theory. Here, we present an alternative view that frames the physiology of dopamine in terms of Bayes-optimal behaviour. In this account, dopamine controls the precision or salience of (external or internal) cues that engender action. In other words, dopamine balances bottom-up sensory information and top-down prior beliefs when making hierarchical inferences (predictions) about cues that have affordance. In this paper, we focus on the consequences of changing tonic levels of dopamine firing using simulations of cued sequential movements. Crucially, the predictions driving movements are based upon a hierarchical generative model that infers the context in which movements are made. This means that we can confuse agents by changing the context (order) in which cues are presented. These simulations provide a (Bayes-optimal) model of contextual uncertainty and set switching that can be quantified in terms of behavioural and electrophysiological responses. Furthermore, one can simulate dopaminergic lesions (by changing the precision of prediction errors) to produce pathological behaviours that are reminiscent of those seen in neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease. We use these simulations to demonstrate how a single functional role for dopamine at the synaptic level can manifest in different ways at the behavioural level. {\\copyright} 2012 Friston et al.},

@article{Jezek11,
	Abstract = {The ability to recall discrete memories is thought to depend on the formation of attractor states in recurrent neural networks. In such networks, representations can be reactivated reliably from subsets of the cues that were present when the memory was encoded, at the same time as interference from competing representations is minimized. Theoretical studies have pointed to the recurrent {CA3} system of the hippocampus as a possible attractor network. Consistent with predictions from these studies, experiments have shown that place representations in {CA3} and downstream {CA1} tolerate small changes in the configuration of the environment but switch to uncorrelated representations when dissimilarities become larger. However, the kinetics supporting such network transitions, at the subsecond timescale, is poorly understood. Here we show in rats that instantaneous transformation of the spatial context does not change the hippocampal representation all at once but is followed by temporary bistability in the discharge activity of {CA3} ensembles. Rather than sliding through a continuum of intermediate activity states, the {CA3} network undergoes a short period of competitive flickering between preformed representations of the past and present environment before settling on the latter. Network flickers are extremely fast, often with complete replacement of the active ensemble from one theta cycle to the next. Within individual cycles, segregation is stronger towards the end, when firing starts to decline, pointing to the theta cycle as a temporal unit for expression of attractor states in the hippocampus. Repetition of pattern-completion processes across successive theta cycles may facilitate error correction and enhance discriminative power in the presence of weak and ambiguous input cues.},

	Abstract = {The motion aftereffect is a robust illusion of visual motion resulting from exposure to a moving pattern. There is a widely accepted explanation of it in terms of changes in the response of cortical direction-selective neurons. Research has distinguished several variants of the effect. Converging recent evidence from different experimental techniques (psychophysics, single-unit recording, brain imaging, transcranial magnetic stimulation, visual evoked potentials and magnetoencephalography) reveals that adaptation is not confined to one or even two cortical areas, but occurs at multiple levels of processing involved in visual motion analysis. A tentative motion-processing framework is described, based on motion aftereffect research. Recent ideas on the function of adaptation see it as a form of gain control that maximises the efficiency of information transmission at multiple levels of the visual pathway.},

@article{Scase96,
	Abstract = {Motion coherence thresholds in random-dot patterns have been widely adopted as a measure of performance in visual motion processing. However, there has been diversity in the type of "noise" in which a coherent motion signal has to be detected. Here we compare coherence thresholds for three ways of creating motion noise: dots replotted in random positions in each new frame; dots with a set displacement but following a random walk from frame to frame; or dots moving in random directions which remain constant for a given dot over a sequence of displacements. In each case, the signal dots may either remain the same throughout the display sequence, or the signal dots may be re-selected afresh on each frame ("different"). With our display (3 deg square, 120 msec exposure, velocity = 5 or 10 deg sec-1), all these different noise conditions yielded similar thresholds around 5-8\%. There were some small but systematic differences between conditions. Thresholds in random-direction displays were consistently higher than those in random-walk or random-position displays, especially at the lower velocity. However, this effect is much smaller than would be expected from the increased standard error of the noise mean in random direction, perhaps because the motion system integrates information most effectively over a local region of space and/or time. Subjects" performance could not be explained by a strategy of identifying individual signal dots with extended trajectories. The similarity between random-walk and random-position thresholds implies that subjects do not exploit the marked differences in speed distribution between signal and noise dots in the latter case. The practical message for the design and interpretation of experiments using coherence thresholds is that the results are not much affected by the choice of noise, at least within the range of stimuli tested here.},

@article{Grossberg01,
	Abstract = {A neural model is developed of how motion integration and segmentation processes, both within and across apertures, compute global motion percepts. Figure-ground properties, such as occlusion, influence which motion signals determine the percept. For visible apertures, a line's terminators do not specify true line motion. For invisible apertures, a line's intrinsic terminators create veridical feature-tracking signals. Sparse feature-tracking signals can be amplified before they propagate across position and are integrated with ambiguous motion signals within line interiors. This integration process determines the global percept. It is the result of several processing stages: directional transient cells respond to image transients and input to a directional short-range filter that selectively boosts feature-tracking signals with the help of competitive signals. Then, a long-range filter inputs to directional cells that pool signals over multiple orientations, opposite contrast polarities, and depths. This all happens no later than cortical area {MT}. The directional cells activate a directional grouping network, proposed to occur within cortical area {MST}, within which directions compete to determine a local winner. Enhanced feature-tracking signals typically win over ambiguous motion signals. Model {MST} cells that encode the winning direction feed back to model {MT} cells, where they boost directionally consistent cell activities and suppress inconsistent activities over the spatial region to which they project. This feedback accomplishes directional and depthful motion capture within that region. Model simulations include the barberpole illusion, motion capture, the spotted barberpole, the triple barberpole, the occluded translating square illusion, motion transparency and the chopsticks illusion. Qualitative explanations of illusory contours from translating terminators and plaid adaptation are also given.},

When tasks were matched on true score variance, spectrum subjects exhibited worse performance on both form and motion discrimination, and a differential deficit in motion recognition with a short display duration and long interstimulus interval.

It is suggested that a deficit in attention resulted in flatter slopes of the psychometric functions. Here, we investigated whether these patients showed a similar deficit in another sensory modality. Specifically, we examined a subset of the schizophrenia patients in a visual task involving motion detection. {METHODS}: A total of 13 schizophrenia patients and 14 normal controls detected the presence of a group of random dots moving in a coherent direction among other dots moving in random directions. Signal intensity varied from trial to trial. Detection sensitivity and bias were computed using signal detection theory. {RESULTS}: The schizophrenia patients were less sensitive in detecting motion stimuli, compared to normal subjects. The decrement in sensitivity varies with signal-to-noise ratio. The two groups did not differ in response bias. {CONCLUSION}: Schizophrenics were impaired in visual, as well as in auditory, attention, in accordance with the idea that attention impairment may represent a core deficit in schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {Motion-induced blindness ({MIB}) occurs when target stimuli are presented together with a moving distractor pattern. Most observers experience the targets disappearing and reappearing repeatedly for periods of up to several seconds. {MIB} can be viewed as a striking marker for the organization of cognitive functioning. In the present study, {MIB} rates and durations were assessed in 34 schizophrenia-spectrum disorder patients and matched controls. The results showed that positive symptoms and excitement enhanced {MIB}, whereas depression and negative symptoms attenuated the illusion. {MIB} was more frequently found in normal subjects. The results remained consistent after adjusting for reaction time and error rates. Hence, {MIB} may provide a valid and reliable measure of cognitive organization in schizophrenia.},

@article{Chen99,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Eye-tracking dysfunction has been found in many patients with schizophrenia and in about 40\% of their first-degree biological relatives. We hypothesized that a deficit in motion processing is associated with eye-tracking dysfunction because both motion signals and the brain regions responsible for processing motion signals are implicated in the generation of smooth pursuit. We examined several aspects of visual perception, including motion perception, in patients with schizophrenia. {METHODS}: To evaluate motion perception, contrast sensitivity for velocity discrimination was measured in patients with schizophrenia (n=15) and normal control subjects (n=18). Contrast sensitivities for orientation discrimination and contrast detection were measured as control tasks. {RESULTS}: Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly lower contrast sensitivity (ie, higher thresholds) than normal controls for the discrimination of small velocity differences (eg, 11 vs 9 degrees/s). This reduction in contrast sensitivity was severe (up to 10-fold) in about 40\% of the patients. No group differences were found on the other tasks. {CONCLUSION}: The discrimination of small velocity differences is impaired in a subgroup of patients with schizophrenia.},

	Abstract = {This special issue focuses on the theme of sensory processing dysfunction in schizophrenia. For more than 50 years, from approximately the time of Bleuler until the early 1960s, sensory function was considered one of the few preserved functions in schizophrenia (Javitt1). Fortunately, the last several decades have brought a renewed and accelerating interest in this topic. The articles included in the issue range from those addressing fundamental bases of sensory dysfunction (Brenner, Yoon, and Turetsky) to those that examine how elementary deficits in sensory processing affect the sensory experience of individuals with schizophrenia (Butler, Kantrowitz, and Coleman) to the question of how sensory-based treatments may lead to improvement in remediation strategies (Adcock). Although addressing only a small portion of the current complex and burgeoning literature on sensory impairments across modalities, the present articles provide a cross-section of the issues currently under investigation. These studies also underscore the severe challenges that individuals with schizophrenia face when trying to decode the complex world around them.},

@article{Kim06,
	Abstract = {Patients with schizophrenia show impairments in motion processing, along with deficits in lower level processing primarily involving the magnocellular visual pathway. The present study investigates potential magnocellular contributions to impaired motion processing in schizophrenia using a combined neurophysiological and behavioral approach. As compared to prior motion studies in schizophrenia, thresholds were determined for both incoherent and coherent visual motion. In this study, velocity discrimination thresholds were measured for schizophrenia patients (n=14) and age-matched normal control subjects (n=16) using a staircase procedure. Early visual processing was evaluated using steady-state visual evoked potentials ({ssVEP}), with stimuli biased toward activation of either the magnocellular or parvocellular visual pathways through luminance contrast manipulation. Patients with schizophrenia showed poor velocity discrimination for both incoherent and coherent motion, with no significant group x task interaction. Further, when coherent motion performance was measured at individually determined incoherent motion thresholds, accuracy levels for patients were similar to controls, also indicating similarity of deficit for incoherent vs. coherent motion discrimination. Impairments in velocity discrimination correlated significantly with reduced amplitude of {ssVEP} elicited by magnocellular -- but not parvocellular -- selective stimuli. This study demonstrates that deficits in motion processing in schizophrenia are significantly related to reduced activation of the magnocellular visual system. Further, this study supports and extends prior reports of impaired motion processing in schizophrenia, and indicates significant bottom-up contributions to higher-order cognitive impairments.},

A reduction of the firing rates of cortical neurons caused for example by reduced {NMDA} receptor function (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the high firing rate attractor states that normally implement short-term memory and attention, contributing to the cognitive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Reduced cortical inhibition caused by a reduction of {GABA} neurotransmission (present in schizophrenia) can lead to instability of the spontaneous firing states of cortical networks, leading to a noise-induced jump to a high firing rate attractor state even in the absence of external inputs, contributing to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. We consider how effects occurring at the time of late adolescence including synaptic pruning, decreases in grey matter volume, and changes in {GABA}-mediated inhibition and dopamine may contribute to the onset in some individuals of schizophrenia at this time.},

	Abstract = {Endophenotypes, measurable components unseen by the unaided eye along the pathway between disease and distal genotype, have emerged as an important concept in the study of complex neuropsychiatric diseases. An endophenotype may be neurophysiological, biochemical, endocrinological, neuroanatomical, cognitive, or neuropsychological (including configured self-report data) in nature. Endophenotypes represent simpler clues to genetic underpinnings than the disease syndrome itself, promoting the view that psychiatric diagnoses can be decomposed or deconstructed, which can result in more straightforward-and successful-genetic analysis. However, to be most useful, endophenotypes for psychiatric disorders must meet certain criteria, including association with a candidate gene or gene region, heritability that is inferred from relative risk for the disorder in relatives, and disease association parameters. In addition to furthering genetic analysis, endophenotypes can clarify classification and diagnosis and foster the development of animal models. The authors discuss the etymology and strategy behind the use of endophenotypes in neuropsychiatric research and, more generally, in research on other diseases with complex genetics.},

More selectively, we address two of the most important questions about saccadic and smooth pursuit eye movements in natural vision. First, why do we saccade to where we do? We argue that, like for many other aspects of vision, several different circuits related to salience, object recognition, actions, and value ultimately interact to determine gaze behavior. Second, how are pursuit eye movements and perceptual experience of visual motion related? We show that motion perception and pursuit have a lot in common, but they also have separate noise sources that can lead to dissociations between them. We emphasize the point that pursuit actively modulates visual perception and that it can provide valuable information for motion perception.},

	Abstract = {We summarize the various strands of research on peripheral vision and relate them to theories of form perception. After a historical overview, we describe quantifications of the cortical magnification hypothesis, including an extension of Schwartz's cortical mapping function. The merits of this concept are considered across a wide range of psychophysical tasks, followed by a discussion of its limitations and the need for non-spatial scaling. We also review the eccentricity dependence of other low-level functions including reaction time, temporal resolution, and spatial summation, as well as perimetric methods. A central topic is then the recognition of characters in peripheral vision, both at low and high levels of contrast, and the impact of surrounding contours known as crowding. We demonstrate how Bouma's law, specifying the critical distance for the onset of crowding, can be stated in terms of the retinocortical mapping. The recognition of more complex stimuli, like textures, faces, and scenes, reveals a substantial impact of mid-level vision and cognitive factors. We further consider eccentricity-dependent limitations of learning, both at the level of perceptual learning and pattern category learning. Generic limitations of extrafoveal vision are observed for the latter in categorization tasks involving multiple stimulus classes. Finally, models of peripheral form vision are discussed. We report that peripheral vision is limited with regard to pattern categorization by a distinctly lower representational complexity and processing speed. Taken together, the limitations of cognitive processing in peripheral vision appear to be as significant as those imposed on low-level functions and by way of crowding. {\\copyright} {ARVO}},

While visual search often seems effortless to humans, trying to recreate human visual search abilities in machines has represented an incredible challenge for computer scientists and engineers. What are the brain computations that ensure successful search? This review article draws on efforts from various subfields and discusses the mechanisms and strategies the brain uses to optimize visual search: the psychophysical evidence, their neural correlates, and if unknown, possible loci of the neural computations. Mechanisms and strategies include use of knowledge about the target, distractor, background statistical properties, location probabilities, contextual cues, scene context, rewards, target prevalence, and also the role of saliency, center--surround organization of search templates, and eye movement plans. I provide overviews of classic and contemporary theories of covert attention and eye movements during search explaining their differences and similarities. To allow the reader to anchor some of the laboratory findings to real-world tasks, the article includes interviews with three expert searchers: a radiologist, a fisherman, and a satellite image analyst.},

	Abstract = {This is a survey of psychophysical studies of motion perception carried out mainly in the last 10 years. It covers a wide range of topics, including the detection and interactions of local motion signals, motion integration across various dimensions for vector computation and global motion perception, second-order motion and feature tracking, motion aftereffects, motion-induced mislocalizations, timing of motion processing, cross-attribute interactions for object motion, motion-induced blindness, and biological motion. While traditional motion research has benefited from the notion of the independent '' motion processing module,'' recent research efforts have been also directed to aspects of motion processing in which interactions with other visual attributes play critical roles. This review tries to highlight the richness and diversity of this large research field and to clarify what has been done and what questions have been left unanswered.},

	Abstract = {Blur is an important attribute of human spatial vision, and sensitivity to blur has been the subject of considerable experimental research and theoretical modeling. Often, these models have invoked specialized concepts or mechanisms, such as intrinsic blur, multiple spatial frequency channels, or blur estimation units. In this paper, we review the several experimental studies of blur discrimination and find that they are in broad empirical agreement. However, contrary to previous modeling efforts, we find that specialized mechanisms are not required and that the essential features of blur discrimination are fully accounted for by a visible contrast energy ({ViCE}) model, in which two spatial patterns are distinguished when the integrated difference between their masked local visible contrast energy responses reaches a threshold value. In the {ViCE} model, intrinsic blur is represented by the high-frequency limb of the contrast sensitivity function, but the low-frequency limb also contributes to the predictions for large reference blurs, and the model includes masking, which improves predictions for high-contrast stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Compared to most ophthalmic technologies, adaptive optics, or {AO}, is relatively young. The first working systems were presented in 1997 and, owing in part to its complexity, the development of {AO} systems has been relatively slow. Nevertheless, {AO} for vision science is coming of age and the scope of applications continues to increase. Applications of {AO} can be broadly split along two lines; for retinal imaging and for testing visual function. This review will focus on the applications of adaptive optics for testing visual function. Since this represents only a subset of the field of {AO} for ophthalmoscopy, it is possible to cite virtually every paper that has been published in the field to date. As such, this is a comprehensive review whose intent is to get all readers up to speed on the state of the art. More importantly, perhaps, this review will focus on the types of science that can be accomplished with {AO} with a view to future applications. The reference list alone is informative, since the reader will quickly discover that the community that is using {AO} for vision science is rather small. Looking at the dates for the cited papers, the reader will also discover that the field is rapidly expanding.},

@article{Tatler11,
	Abstract = {Models of gaze allocation in complex scenes are derived mainly from studies of static picture viewing. The dominant framework to emerge has been image salience, where properties of the stimulus play a crucial role in guiding the eyes. However, salience-based schemes are poor at accounting for many aspects of picture viewing and can fail dramatically in the context of natural task performance. These failures have led to the development of new models of gaze allocation in scene viewing that address a number of these issues. However, models based on the picture-viewing paradigm are unlikely to generalize to a broader range of experimental contexts, because the stimulus context is limited, and the dynamic, task-driven nature of vision is not represented. We argue that there is a need to move away from this class of model and find the principles that govern gaze allocation in a broader range of settings. We outline the major limitations of salience-based selection schemes and highlight what we have learned from studies of gaze allocation in natural vision. Clear principles of selection are found across many instances of natural vision and these are not the principles that might be expected from picture-viewing studies. We discuss the emerging theoretical framework for gaze allocation on the basis of reward maximization and uncertainty reduction.},

	Abstract = {Offering proper evaluation methodology is essential to continue progress in modelling neural mechanisms in vision/visual information processing. Currently, evaluation of motion estimation models lacks a proper methodology for comparing their performance against the visual system. Here, we set the basis for such a new benchmark methodology which is based on human visual performance as measured in psychophysics, ocular following and neurobiology. This benchmark will enable comparisons between different kinds of models, but also it will challenge current motion estimation models and better characterize their properties with respect to visual cortex performance. To do so, we propose a database of image sequences taken from neuroscience and psychophysics literature. In this article, we focus on two aspects of motion estimation, which are the dynamics of motion integration and the respective influence between {1D} versus {2D} cues. Then, since motion models possibly deal with different kinds of motion representations and scale, we define here two general readouts based on a global motion estimation. Such readouts, namely eye movements and perceived motion will serve as a reference to compare simulated and experimental data. We evaluate the performance of several models on this data to establish the current state of the art. Models chosen for comparison have very different properties and internal mechanisms, such as feedforward normalisation of V1 and {MT} processing and recurrent feedback. As a whole, we provide here the basis for a valuable evaluation methodology to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of the visual cortex in motion perception. Our database is freely available on the web together with scoring instructions and results at http://www-sop.inria.fr/neuromathcomp/software/motionpsychobench},

@article{Touboul11a,
	Abstract = {The brain's activity is characterized by the interaction of a very large number of neurons that are strongly affected by noise. However, signals often arise at macroscopic scales integrating the effect of many neurons into a reliable pattern of activity. In order to study such large neuronal assemblies, one is often led to derive mean-field limits summarizing the effect of the interaction of a large number of neurons into an effective signal. Classical mean-field approaches consider the evolution of a deterministic variable, the mean activity, thus neglecting the stochastic nature of neural behavior. In this article, we build upon two recent approaches that include correlations and higher order moments in mean-field equations, and study how these stochastic effects influence the solutions of the mean-field equations, both in the limit of an infinite number of neurons and for large yet finite networks. We introduce a new model, the infinite model, which arises from both equations by a rescaling of the variables and, which is invertible for finite-size networks, and hence, provides equivalent equations to those previously derived models. The study of this model allows us to understand qualitative behavior of such large-scale networks. We show that, though the solutions of the deterministic mean-field equation constitute uncorrelated solutions of the new mean-field equations, the stability properties of limit cycles are modified by the presence of correlations, and additional non-trivial behaviors including periodic orbits appear when there were none in the mean field. The origin of all these behaviors is then explored in finite-size networks where interesting mesoscopic scale effects appear. This study leads us to show that the infinite-size system appears as a singular limit of the network equations, and for any finite network, the system will differ from the infinite system.},

	Abstract = {Sensory information is actively gathered by animals, but the synaptic mechanisms driving neuronal circuit function during active sensory processing are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the synaptically driven membrane potential dynamics during active whisker sensation using whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons in the primary somatosensory barrel cortex of behaving mice. Although whisker contact with an object evoked rapid depolarization in all neurons, these touch responses only drove action potentials in <10\% of the cells. Such sparse coding was ensured by cell-specific reversal potentials of the touch-evoked response that were hyperpolarized relative to action potential threshold for most neurons. Intercontact interval profoundly influenced touch-evoked postsynaptic potentials, interestingly without affecting the peak membrane potential of the touch response. Dual whole-cell recordings indicated highly correlated membrane potential dynamics during active touch. Sparse action potential firing within synchronized cortical layer 2/3 microcircuits therefore appears to robustly signal each active touch response. º Whole-cell recordings from layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons during active touch º Active touch evokes dense subthreshold depolarizations but sparse action potentials º Reversal potential of the postsynaptic touch response determines firing probability º Membrane potentials in nearby neurons are highly correlated during active touch},

@article{Wu11,
	Abstract = {Statistical inferences are essentially important in analyzing neural spike trains in computational neuroscience. Current approaches have followed a general inference paradigm where a parametric probability model is often used to characterize the temporal evolution of the underlying stochastic processes. To directly capture the overall variability and distribution in the space of the spike trains, we focus on a data-driven approach where statistics are defined and computed in the function space in which spike trains are viewed as individual points. To this end, we at first develop a parametrized family of metrics that takes into account different warpings in the time domain and generalizes several currently used spike train distances. These new metrics are essentially penalized L p norms, involving appropriate functions of spike trains, with penalties associated with time-warping. The notions of means and variances of spike trains are then defined based on the new metrics when p = 2 (corresponding to the '' Euclidean distance''). Using some restrictive conditions, we present an efficient recursive algorithm, termed {Matching-Minimization} algorithm, to compute the sample mean of a set of spike trains with arbitrary numbers of spikes. The proposed metrics as well as the mean spike trains are demonstrated using simulations as well as an experimental recording from the motor cortex. It is found that all these methods achieve desirable performance and the results support the success of this novel framework.},

@article{Lim11,
	Abstract = {By varying the noise intensity, we study stochastic spiking coherence (i.e., collective coherence between noise-induced neural spikings) in an inhibitory population of subthreshold neurons (which cannot fire spontaneously without noise). This stochastic spiking coherence may be well visualized in the raster plot of neural spikes. For a coherent case, partially-occupied '' stripes'' (composed of spikes and indicating collective coherence) are formed in the raster plot. This partial occupation occurs due to '' stochastic spike skipping'' which is well shown in the multi-peaked interspike interval histogram. The main purpose of our work is to quantitatively measure the degree of stochastic spiking coherence seen in the raster plot. We introduce a new spike-based coherence measure M s by considering the occupation pattern and the pacing pattern of spikes in the stripes. In particular, the pacing degree between spikes is determined in a statistical-mechanical way by quantifying the average contribution of (microscopic) individual spikes to the (macroscopic) ensemble-averaged global potential. This '' statistical-mechanical'' measure M s is in contrast to the conventional measures such as the '' thermodynamic'' order parameter (which concerns the time-averaged fluctuations of the macroscopic global potential), the '' microscopic'' correlation-based measure (based on the cross-correlation between the microscopic individual potentials), and the measures of precise spike timing (based on the peri-stimulus time histogram). In terms of M s , we quantitatively characterize the stochastic spiking coherence, and find that M s reflects the degree of collective spiking coherence seen in the raster plot very well. Hence, the '' statistical-mechanical'' spike-based measure M s may be used usefully to quantify the degree of stochastic spiking coherence in a statistical-mechanical way.},

	Abstract = {The neuronal system underlying learning, generation and recognition of song in birds is one of the best-studied systems in the neurosciences. Here, we use these experimental findings to derive a neurobiologically plausible, dynamic, hierarchical model of birdsong generation and transform it into a functional model of birdsong recognition. The generation model consists of neuronal rate models and includes critical anatomical components like the premotor song-control nucleus {HVC} (proper name), the premotor nucleus {RA} (robust nucleus of the arcopallium), and a model of the syringeal and respiratory organs. We use Bayesian inference of this dynamical system to derive a possible mechanism for how birds can efficiently and robustly recognize the songs of their conspecifics in an online fashion. Our results indicate that the specific way birdsong is generated enables a listening bird to robustly and rapidly perceive embedded information at multiple time scales of a song. The resulting mechanism can be useful for investigating the functional roles of auditory recognition areas and providing predictions for future birdsong experiments. How do birds communicate via their songs? Investigating this question may not only lead to a better understanding of communication via birdsong, but many believe that the answer will also give us hints about how humans decode speech from complex sound wave modulations. In birds, the output and neuronal responses of the song generation system can be measured precisely and this has resulted in a considerable body of experimental findings. We used these findings to assemble a complete model of birdsong generation and use it as the basis for constructing a potentially neurobiologically plausible, artificial recognition system based on state-of-the-art Bayesian inference techniques. Our artificial system resembles the real birdsong system when performing recognition tasks and may be used as a functional model to explain and predict experimental findings in song recognition.},

	Abstract = {Experiments in systems neuroscience can be seen as consisting of three steps: (1) selecting the signals we are interested in, (2) probing the system with carefully chosen stimuli, and (3) getting data out of the brain. Here I discuss how emerging techniques in molecular biology are starting to improve these three steps. To estimate its future impact on experimental neuroscience, I will stress the analogy of ongoing progress with that of microprocessor production techniques. These techniques have allowed computers to simplify countless problems; because they are easier to use than mechanical timers, they are even built into toasters. Molecular biology may advance even faster than computer speeds and has made immense progress in understanding and designing molecules. These advancements may in turn produce impressive improvements to each of the three steps, ultimately shifting the bottleneck from obtaining data to interpreting it.},

@article{Chan79,
	Abstract = {Beginning with the derivation of a least squares estimator that yields an estimate of the acceleration input vector, this paper first develops a detector for sensing target maneuvers and then develops the combination of the estimator, detector, and a "simple" Kalman filter to form a tracker for maneuvering targets. Finally, some simulation results are presented. A relationship between the actual residuals, assuming target maneuvers, and the theoretical residuals of the "simple" Kalman filter that assumes no maneuvers, is first formulated. The estimator then computes a constant acceleration input vector that best fits that relationship. The result is a least squares estimator of the input vector which can be used to update the "simple" Kalman filter. Since typical targets spend considerable periods of time in the constant course and speed mode, a detector is used to guard against automatic updating of the "simple" Kalman filter. A maneuver is declared, and updating performed, only if the norm of the estimated input vector exceeds a threshold. The tracking sclheme is easy to implement and its capability is illustrated in three tracking examples.},

@article{Pecevski11,
	Abstract = {An important open problem of computational neuroscience is the generic organization of computations in networks of neurons in the brain. We show here through rigorous theoretical analysis that inherent stochastic features of spiking neurons, in combination with simple nonlinear computational operations in specific network motifs and dendritic arbors, enable networks of spiking neurons to carry out probabilistic inference through sampling in general graphical models. In particular, it enables them to carry out probabilistic inference in Bayesian networks with converging arrows ( '' explaining away'') and with undirected loops, that occur in many real-world tasks. Ubiquitous stochastic features of networks of spiking neurons, such as trial-to-trial variability and spontaneous activity, are necessary ingredients of the underlying computational organization. We demonstrate through computer simulations that this approach can be scaled up to neural emulations of probabilistic inference in fairly large graphical models, yielding some of the most complex computations that have been carried out so far in networks of spiking neurons. Experimental data from neuroscience have provided substantial knowledge about the intricate structure of cortical microcircuits, but their functional role, i.e. the computational calculus that they employ in order to interpret ambiguous stimuli, produce predictions, and derive movement plans has remained largely unknown. Earlier assumptions that these circuits implement a logic-like calculus have run into problems, because logical inference has turned out to be inadequate to solve inference problems in the real world which often exhibits substantial degrees of uncertainty. In this article we propose an alternative theoretical framework for examining the functional role of precisely structured motifs of cortical microcircuits and dendritic computations in complex neurons, based on probabilistic inference through sampling. We show that these structural details endow cortical columns and areas with the capability to represent complex knowledge about their environment in the form of higher order dependencies among salient variables. We show that it also enables them to use this knowledge for probabilistic inference that is capable to deal with uncertainty in stored knowledge and current observations. We demonstrate in computer simulations that the precisely structured neuronal microcircuits enable networks of spiking neurons to solve through their inherent stochastic dynamics a variety of complex probabilistic inference tasks.},

@article{Buesing11,
	Abstract = {The organization of computations in networks of spiking neurons in the brain is still largely unknown, in particular in view of the inherently stochastic features of their firing activity and the experimentally observed trial-to-trial variability of neural systems in the brain. In principle there exists a powerful computational framework for stochastic computations, probabilistic inference by sampling, which can explain a large number of macroscopic experimental data in neuroscience and cognitive science. But it has turned out to be surprisingly difficult to create a link between these abstract models for stochastic computations and more detailed models of the dynamics of networks of spiking neurons. Here we create such a link and show that under some conditions the stochastic firing activity of networks of spiking neurons can be interpreted as probabilistic inference via Markov chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) sampling. Since common methods for {MCMC} sampling in distributed systems, such as Gibbs sampling, are inconsistent with the dynamics of spiking neurons, we introduce a different approach based on non-reversible Markov chains that is able to reflect inherent temporal processes of spiking neuronal activity through a suitable choice of random variables. We propose a neural network model and show by a rigorous theoretical analysis that its neural activity implements {MCMC} sampling of a given distribution, both for the case of discrete and continuous time. This provides a step towards closing the gap between abstract functional models of cortical computation and more detailed models of networks of spiking neurons.},

@article{Souman10,
	Abstract = {Perceived visual speed has been reported to be reduced during walking. This reduction has been attributed to a partial subtraction of walking speed from visual speed (F. H. Durgin \& K. Gigone, 2007; F. H. Durgin, K. Gigone, \& R. Scott, 2005). We tested whether observers still have access to the retinal flow before subtraction takes place. Observers performed a {2IFC} visual speed discrimination task while walking on a treadmill. In one condition, walking speed was identical in the two intervals, while in a second condition walking speed differed between intervals. If observers have access to the retinal flow before subtraction, any changes in walking speed across intervals should not affect their ability to discriminate retinal flow speed. Contrary to this "direct access hypothesis," we found that observers were worse at discrimination when walking speed differed between intervals. The results therefore suggest that observers do not have access to retinal flow before subtraction. We also found that the amount of subtraction depended on the visual speed presented, suggesting that the interaction between the processing of visual input and of self-motion is more complex than previously proposed.},

This paper proposes a new mechanism of extracting local velocity from retinal images, and adds it to the previous network. The network has a hierarchical multilayered architecture. X- and Y-cells of the retina extract spatial and temporal contrast of brightness. The network contains several types of V1 cells, namely, S- C- and V-cells. S- and C-cells extract orientated edges. V-cells extract local velocities, based on the signals from Y- and S-cells. {MT} cells extract relative velocities between adjoining small visual fields. {MST} cells add the responses of {MT} cells to extract a specific optic flow, such as rotation and expansion/contraction. The difference in type of optic flow extracted by {MST} cells can be created simply by the difference in relative locations of inhibitory to excitatory areas in the receptive fields of {MT} cells.},

@article{Spratling11,
	Abstract = {Cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression have been extensively studied in primary visual cortex (V1). These two forms of suppression have some distinct properties which has led to the suggestion that they are generated by different underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, it has been suggested that mechanisms other than intracortical inhibition may be central to both forms of suppression. A simple computational model ({PC}/{BC}), in which intracortical inhibition is fundamental, is shown to simulate the distinct properties of cross-orientation and surround suppression. The same model has previously been shown to account for a large range of V1 response properties including orientation-tuning, spatial and temporal frequency tuning, facilitation and inhibition by flankers and textured surrounds as well as a range of other experimental results on cross-orientation suppression and surround suppression. The current results thus provide additional support for the {PC}/{BC} model of V1 and for the proposal that the diverse range of response properties observed in V1 neurons have a single computational explanation. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that current neurophysiological evidence is insufficient to discount intracortical inhibition as a central mechanism underlying both forms of suppression.

@article{Shirazi04,
	Abstract = {The recent consensus is that virtually all aspects of response selectivity exhibited by the primary visual cortex are either created or sharpened by cortical inhibitory interneurons. Experimental studies have shown that there are cortical inhibitory cells that are driven by geniculate cells and that, like their cortical excitatory counterparts, are orientation selective, though less sharply tuned. The main goal of this article is to demonstrate how orientation-selective inhibition might be created by the circuitry of the primary visual cortex (striate cortex, V1) from its nonoriented geniculate inputs. To fulfill this goal, first, a {Bayes-Markov} computational model is developed for the V1 area dedicated to foveal vision. The developed model consists of three parts: (i) a two-layered hierarchical Markov random field that is assumed to generate the activity patterns of the geniculate and cortical inhibitory cells, (ii) a Bayesian computational goal that is formulated based on the maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) estimation principle, and (iii) an iterative, deterministic, parallel algorithm that leads the cortical circuitry to achieve its assigned computational goal. The developed model is not fully {LGN} driven and it is not implementable by the neural machinery of V1. The model, then, is transformed into a fully {LGN}-driven and physiologically plausible form. Computer simulation is used to demonstrate the performance of the developed models.},

@article{Wilson92,
	Abstract = {A quantitative model is developed to predict the perceived direction of moving two-dimensional patterns. The model incorporates both a simple motion energy pathway and a "texture boundary motion" pathway that incorporates response squaring before the extraction of motion energy. These pathways correspond to Fourier and {non-Fourier} motion pathways and are hypothesized to reflect processing in the {V1-MT} and {V1-V2}-{MT} pathway, respectively. A cosine-weighted sum of these pathways followed by competitive feedback inhibition accurately predicts the perceived direction for patterns composed of two cosine gratings at different orientations ("plaids"). The model also predicts direction discrimination, differences between foveal and peripheral viewing, changes in perceived direction with exposure duration, motion masking, and motion transparency.},

@article{Wallace05,
	Abstract = {Pursuing an object with smooth eye movements requires an accurate estimate of its two-dimensional ({2D}) trajectory. This {2D} motion computation requires that different local motion measurements are extracted and combined to recover the global object-motion direction and speed. Several combination rules have been proposed such as vector averaging ({VA}), intersection of constraints ({IOC}), or {2D} feature tracking ({2DFT}). To examine this computation, we investigated the time course of smooth pursuit eye movements driven by simple objects of different shapes. For type {II} diamond (where the direction of true object motion is dramatically different from the vector average of the 1-dimensional edge motions, i.e., {VA} not equal {IOC} = {2DFT}), the ocular tracking is initiated in the vector average direction. Over a period of less than 300 ms, the eye-tracking direction converges on the true object motion. The reduction of the tracking error starts before the closing of the oculomotor loop. For type I diamonds (where the direction of true object motion is identical to the vector average direction, i.e., {VA} = {IOC} = {2DFT}), there is no such bias. We quantified this effect by calculating the direction error between responses to types I and {II} and measuring its maximum value and time constant. At low contrast and high speeds, the initial bias in tracking direction is larger and takes longer to converge onto the actual object-motion direction. This effect is attenuated with the introduction of more {2D} information to the extent that it was totally obliterated with a texture-filled type {II} diamond. These results suggest a flexible {2D} computation for motion integration, which combines all available one-dimensional (edge) and {2D} (feature) motion information to refine the estimate of object-motion direction over time.},

@article{Tsui10,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the primate extrastriate cortex are highly selective for complex stimulus features such as faces, objects, and motion patterns. One explanation for this selectivity is that neurons in these areas carry out sophisticated computations on the outputs of lower-level areas such as primary visual cortex (V1), where neuronal selectivity is often modeled in terms of linear spatiotemporal filters. However, it has long been known that such simple V1 models are incomplete because they fail to capture important nonlinearities that can substantially alter neuronal selectivity for specific stimulus features. Thus a key step in understanding the function of higher cortical areas is the development of realistic models of their V1 inputs. We have addressed this issue by constructing a computational model of the V1 neurons that provide the strongest input to extrastriate cortical middle temporal ({MT}) area. We find that a modest elaboration to the standard model of V1 direction selectivity generates model neurons with strong end-stopping, a property that is also found in the V1 layers that provide input to {MT}. With this computational feature in place, the seemingly complex properties of {MT} neurons can be simulated by assuming that they perform a simple nonlinear summation of their inputs. The resulting model, which has a very small number of free parameters, can simulate many of the diverse properties of {MT} neurons. In particular, we simulate the invariance of {MT} tuning curves to the orientation and length of tilted bar stimuli, as well as the accompanying temporal dynamics. We also show how this property relates to the continuum from component to pattern selectivity observed when {MT} neurons are tested with plaids. Finally, we confirm several key predictions of the model by recording from {MT} neurons in the alert macaque monkey. Overall our results demonstrate that many of the seemingly complex computations carried out by high-level cortical neurons can in principle be understood by examining the properties of their inputs.},

	Abstract = {The middle temporal visual area ({MT}) in macaque extrastriate cortex is characterized by a high proportion of neurons selective for the direction of stimulus motion, and is thus thought to play an important role in motion perception. Previous studies identified a population of cells in {MT} that appeared capable of coding the motion of whole visual patterns independent of the motions of contours within them (Gizzi et al. 1983; Movshon et al. 1985). These "pattern-motion selective" neurons are unlike motion sensitive cells that have been observed at earlier stages of the visual system. Using very different criteria, we have also previously identified an apparently functionally distinct group of {MT} neurons (Albright 1984). We predicted that these "Type {II}" neurons correspond to the pattern-motion neurons. In the present study, we have applied both sets of criteria to individual neurons in {MT} and found that these two differently defined sets of cells actually form the same population. These results support the idea that {MT} contributes to a specialized type of motion processing which reflects the integrity of normal perception.},

@article{Majaj07,
	Abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in primary visual cortex have small receptive fields that encode the motions of local features. These motions often differ from the motion of the object to which they belong and must therefore be integrated elsewhere. A candidate site for this integration is visual cortical area {MT} (V5), in which cells with large receptive fields compute the motion of patterns. Previous studies of motion integration in {MT} have used stimuli that fill the receptive field, and thus do not test whether motion information is really integrated across this whole area. For each {MT} neuron, we identified two regions ("patches") within the receptive field that were approximately equally effective in driving responses. We then measured responses to plaids whose component gratings overlapped within a patch, and compared them with responses to the same component gratings presented in separate patches. Cells that were selective for the direction of motion of the whole pattern when the gratings overlapped lost this selectivity when the gratings were separated and became selective instead for the direction of motion of the individual components. If {MT} cells simply pooled all of the inputs that endow them with a receptive field, they would encode all of the motions in the receptive field as belonging to a single object. Our results indicate instead that critical elements of the computations underlying pattern-direction selectivity in {MT} are done locally, on a scale smaller than the whole receptive field.},

@article{Born06,
	Abstract = {The smooth pursuit system must integrate many local motion measurements into a coherent estimate of target velocity. Several laboratories have studied this integration process using eye movements elicited by targets, such as tilted bars, containing conflicts between local motion signals measured along contours [one dimensional ({1D})] and those measured at the bar's endpoints, or terminators [two dimensional ({2D})]. The general finding is that {1D} signals dominate early responses, whereas later components of the behavior are determined by {2D} signals. We studied the dynamics of the integration process in macaque monkeys by systematically varying the relative proportions of {1D} and {2D} signals and the retinal eccentricities at which they appeared. Predictably, longer bars produced greater and longer-lasting contour-induced deviations. The evolution of the {2D} response occurred over a period of 50-400 ms, depending on the relative proportions of {1D} and {2D} signals. As contours were displaced from the fovea the deviation decreased but much less so for early (1st 40 ms) than for late (subsequent 40 ms) pursuit initiation. These bottom-up effects could be overcome to a limited extent by the top-down influence of predictability. Finally, we observed that when animals were free to track any part of the bar, they spontaneously made short-latency saccades to the terminators on most trials, especially when the bars were tilted. This suggests an increased saliency of moving terminators, particularly when discrepancies exist among local motion signals.},

	Abstract = {Motion of an extended boundary can be measured locally by neurons only orthogonal to its orientation (aperture problem) while this ambiguity is resolved for localized image features, such as corners or nonocclusion junctions. The integration of local motion signals sampled along the outline of a moving form reveals the object velocity. We propose a new model of {V1-MT} feedforward and feedback processing in which localized V1 motion signals are integrated along the feedforward path by model {MT} cells. Top-down feedback from {MT} cells in turn emphasizes model V1 motion activities of matching velocity by excitatory modulation and thus realizes an attentional gating mechanism. The model dynamics implement a guided filling-in process to disambiguate motion signals through biased on-center, off-surround competition. Our model makes predictions concerning the time course of cells in area {MT} and V1 and the disambiguation process of activity patterns in these areas and serves as a means to link physiological mechanisms with perceptual behavior. We further demonstrate that our model also successfully processes natural image sequences.},

	Abstract = {We present a novel class of particle methods with deformable shapes that achieve high-order convergence rates in the supremum norm. These methods do not require remappings or extended overlapping or vanishing moments for the particles. Unlike classical convergence analysis, our estimates do not rely on a smoothing kernel argument but rather on the uniformly bounded overlapping of the particles supports and on the smoothness of the characteristic flow. In particular, they also apply to heterogeneous "particle approximations" such as piecewise polynomial bases on unstructured meshes. In the first-order case which simply consists of pushing forward linearly transformed particles ({LTP}) along the flow, we provide an explicit scheme and establish rigorous error estimates that demonstrate its uniform convergence and the uniform boundedness of the particle overlapping. To illustrate the flexibility of the method we also develop an adaptive multilevel version that includes a local correction filter for positivity-preserving hierarchical approximations. Numerical studies demonstrate the convergence properties of this new particle scheme in both its uniform and adaptive versions, and compare it with traditional fixed-shape particle methods with or without remappings.},

The controversy occurs partially because most {VPL} studies have examined correlations between behavioral and neural activity changes rather than cause-and-effect relationships. With an online-feedback method that uses decoded functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) signals, we induced activity patterns only in early visual cortex corresponding to an orientation without stimulus presentation or participants' awareness of what was to be learned. The induced activation caused {VPL} specific to the orientation. These results suggest that early visual areas are so plastic that mere inductions of activity patterns are sufficient to cause {VPL}. This technique can induce plasticity in a highly selective manner, potentially leading to powerful training and rehabilitative protocols.},

We show that this mechanism provides an explanation for the sparse firing patterns observed in response to natural stimuli and fits well with a recently observed interaction of excitatory and inhibitory receptive field plasticity. The introduction of inhibitory plasticity in suitable recurrent networks provides a homeostatic mechanism that leads to asynchronous irregular network states. Further, it can accommodate synaptic memories with activity patterns that become indiscernible from the background state but can be reactivated by external stimuli.

	Abstract = {Visual cognition depends critically on the moment-to-moment orientation of gaze. To change the gaze to a new location in space, that location must be computed and used by the oculomotor system. One of the most common sources of information for this computation is the visual appearance of an object. A crucial question is: How is the appearance information contained in the photometric array is converted into a target position? This paper proposes a such a model that accomplishes this calculation. The model uses iconic scene representations derived from oriented spatiochromatic filters at multiple scales. Visual search for a target object proceeds in a coarse-to-fine fashion with the target's largest scale filter responses being compared first. Task-relevant target locations are represented as saliency maps which are used to program eye movements. A central feature of the model is that it separates the targeting process, which changes gaze, from the decision process, which extracts information at or near the new gaze point to guide behavior. The model provides a detailed explanation for center-of-gravity saccades that have been observed in many previous experiments. In addition, the model's targeting performance has been compared with the eye movements of human subjects under identical conditions in natural visual search tasks. The results show good agreement both quantitatively (the search paths are strikingly similar) and qualitatively (the fixations of false targets are comparable).},

	Abstract = {A large number of human psychophysical results have been successfully explained in recent years using Bayesian models. However, the neural implementation of such models remains largely unclear. In this article, we show that a network architecture commonly used to model the cerebral cortex can implement Bayesian inference for an arbitrary hidden Markov model. We illustrate the approach using an orientation discrimination task and a visual motion detection task. In the case of orientation discrimination, we show that the model network can infer the posterior distribution over orientations and correctly estimate stimulus orientation in the presence of significant noise. In the case of motion detection, we show that the resulting model network exhibits direction selectivity and correctly computes the posterior probabilities over motion direction and position. When used to solve the well-known random dots motion discrimination task, the model generates responses that mimic the activities of evidence-accumulating neurons in cortical areas {LIP} and {FEF}. The framework we introduce posits a new interpretation of cortical activities in terms of log posterior probabilities of stimuli occurring in the natural world.},

	Abstract = {When a flash is aligned with a moving object, subjects perceive the flash to lag behind the moving object. Two different models have been proposed to explain this ?flash-lag? effect.

	Abstract = {{Abstract\&nbsp;\&nbsp;The} adaptive effects of prolonged viewing of conditioning motion on ocular following responses ({OFRs}) elicited by brief test motion of a random-dot pattern were studied in humans. We found that the {OFRs} were significantly reduced when the directions of the conditioning and test motions were the same. The effect of conditioning motion was still observed when the speeds of the conditioning and test motions did not match. The effect was larger when the conditioning duration was longer, and decayed over time with increased temporal separation between the conditioning and test periods. These results are consistent with the characteristics of motion adaptation on the initial smooth pursuit responses. We also obtained data suggesting that the persistence of the effect depends on visual stimulation in the time between the conditioning and test periods, and that the presence of a stationary visual stimulus facilitates recovery from the motion adaptation.},

	Abstract = {Using the scleral search coil technique to monitor eye movements, we recorded short-latency ocular following responses to displacement steps of large random-dot patterns. On half of the trials, the luminance of the dots and background were reversed during the step, a procedure that is known to reverse the direction of the perceived motion ( '' reverse phi''). Steps without luminance reversal induced small but consistent ocular following in the direction of the steps at ultra-short latency (<80 ms). Steps with luminance reversal induced small but consistent tracking at the same latency but in the direction opposite to the actual displacement. Tuning curves describing the dependence of initial ocular following on the amplitude of the displacement had a form approximating the derivative of a Gaussian and were well fit by Gabor functions, the cosine term being phase shifted 180\\$\\\\,^{\\\\circ}\\$ by the luminance reversal. This result is consistent with the idea that the initial ocular following is mediated, at least in part, by first-order (luminance) motion-energy detectors.},

	Abstract = {We deal with the analysis of eye movements made on natural movies in free-viewing conditions. Saccades are detected and used to label two classes of movie patches as attended and non-attended. Machine learning techniques are then used to determine how well the two classes can be separated, i.e., how predictable saccade targets are. Although very simple saliency measures are used and then averaged to obtain just one average value per scale, the two classes can be separated with an {ROC} score of around 0.7, which is higher than previously reported results. Moreover, predictability is analysed for different representations to obtain indirect evidence for the likelihood of a particular representation. It is shown that the predictability correlates with the local intrinsic dimension in a movie.},

	Abstract = {We describe an algorithm for manipulating the temporal resolution of a video in real time, contingent upon the viewer's direction of gaze. The purpose of this work is to study the effect that a controlled manipulation of the temporal frequency content in real-world scenes has on eye movements. We build on the work of Perry and Geisler [1998; 2002], who manipulate spatial resolution as a function of gaze direction, allowing them to mimic the resolution distribution of the human retina or to simulate the effect of various diseases (e.g. {glaucoma).Our} temporal filtering algorithm is similar to that of Perry and Geisler in that we interpolate between the levels of a multiresolution pyramid. However, in our case, the pyramid is built along the temporal dimension, and this requires careful management of the buffering of video frames and of the order in which the filtering operations are performed. On a standard personal computer, the algorithm achieves real-time performance (30 frames per second) on high-resolution videos (960 by 540 {pixels).We} present experimental results showing that the manipulation performed by the algorithm reduces the number of high-amplitude saccades and can remain unnoticed by the observer.},

@article{Barth10,
	Abstract = {Based on the principle of efficient coding, we present a theoretical framework for how to categorize the basic types of changes that can occur in a spatio-temporal signal. First, theoretical results for the problem of estimating multiple transparent motions are reviewed. Then, confidence measures for the presence of multiple motions are used to derive a basic alphabet of local signal variation that includes motion layers. To better understand and visualize this alphabet, a representation of motions in the projective plane is used. A further, practical contribution is an interactive tool that allows generating multiple motion patterns and displaying them in various apertures. In our framework, we can explain some well-known results on coherent motion and a few more complex perceptual phenomena such as the {2D}--{1D} entrainment effect, but the focus of this paper is on the methods. Our working hypothesis is that efficient representations can be obtained by suppressing all the redundancies that arise if the visual input does not change in a particular direction, or a set of directions. Finally, we assume that human eye movements will tend to avoid the redundant parts of the visual input and report results where our framework has been used to obtain very good predictions of eye movements made on overlaid natural videos.},

@article{Dorr10,
	Abstract = {How similar are the eye movement patterns of different subjects when free viewing dynamic natural scenes? We collected a large database of eye movements from 54 subjects on 18 high-resolution videos of outdoor scenes and measured their variability using the Normalized Scanpath Saliency, which we extended to the temporal domain. Even though up to about 80\% of subjects looked at the same image region in some video parts, variability usually was much greater. Eye movements on natural movies were then compared with eye movements in several control conditions. "Stop-motion" movies had almost identical semantic content as the original videos but lacked continuous motion. Hollywood action movie trailers were used to probe the upper limit of eye movement coherence that can be achieved by deliberate camera work, scene cuts, etc. In a "repetitive" condition, subjects viewed the same movies ten times each over the course of 2 days. Results show several systematic differences between conditions both for general eye movement parameters such as saccade amplitude and fixation duration and for eye movement variability. Most importantly, eye movements on static images are initially driven by stimulus onset effects and later, more so than on continuous videos, by subject-specific idiosyncrasies; eye movements on Hollywood movies are significantly more coherent than those on natural movies. We conclude that the stimuli types often used in laboratory experiments, static images and professionally cut material, are not very representative of natural viewing behavior. All stimuli and gaze data are publicly available at http://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/tools-demos/gaze.},

@article{Barlow89,
	Abstract = {What use can the brain make of the massive flow of sensory information that occurs without any associated rewards or punishments? This question is reviewed in the light of connectionist models of unsupervised learning and some older ideas, namely the cognitive maps and working models of Tolman and Craik, and the idea that redundancy is important for understanding perception (Attneave 1954), the physiology of sensory pathways (Barlow 1959), and pattern recognition (Watanabe 1960). It is argued that (1) The redundancy of sensory messages provides the knowledge incorporated in the maps or models. (2) Some of this knowledge can be obtained by observations of mean, variance, and covariance of sensory messages, and perhaps also by a method called ?minimum entropy coding.? (3) Such knowledge may be incorporated in a model of ?what usually happens? with which incoming messages are automatically compared, enabling unexpected discrepancies to be immediately identified. (4) Knowledge of the sort incorporated into such a filter is a necessary prerequisite of ordinary learning, and a representation whose elements are independent makes it possible to form associations with logical functions of the elements, not just with the elements themselves.},

We describe a low-rank approximation to this interaction tensor that uses a sum of factors, each of which is a three-way outer product. This approximation allows efficient learning of transformations between larger image patches. Since each factor can be viewed as an image filter, the model as a whole learns optimal filter pairs for efficiently representing transformations.

@article{Laptev07,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of motion recognition using event-based local motion representations. We assume that similar patterns of motion contain similar events with consistent motion across image sequences. Using this assumption, we formulate the problem of motion recognition as a matching of corresponding events in image sequences. To enable the matching, we present and evaluate a set of motion descriptors that exploit the spatial and the temporal coherence of motion measurements between corresponding events in image sequences. As the motion measurements may depend on the relative motion of the camera, we also present a mechanism for local velocity adaptation of events and evaluate its influence when recognizing image sequences subjected to different camera motions. When recognizing motion patterns, we compare the performance of a nearest neighbor ({NN}) classifier with the performance of a support vector machine ({SVM}). We also compare event-based motion representations to motion representations in terms of global histograms. A systematic experimental evaluation on a large video database with human actions demonstrates that (i) local spatio-temporal image descriptors can be defined to carry important information of space-time events for subsequent recognition, and that (ii) local velocity adaptation is an important mechanism in situations when the relative motion between the camera and the interesting events in the scene is unknown. The particular advantage of event-based representations and velocity adaptation is further emphasized when recognizing human actions in unconstrained scenes with complex and non-stationary backgrounds.},

	Abstract = {Chemotaxis plays a crucial role in many biological processes, including nervous system development. However, fundamental physical constraints limit the ability of a small sensing device such as a cell or growth cone to detect an external chemical gradient. One of these is the stochastic nature of receptor binding, leading to a constantly fluctuating binding pattern across the cell's array of receptors. This is analogous to the uncertainty in sensory information often encountered by the brain at the systems level. Here we derive analytically the Bayes-optimal strategy for combining information from a spatial array of receptors in both one and two dimensions to determine gradient direction. We also show how information from more than one receptor species can be optimally integrated, derive the gradient shapes that are optimal for guiding cells or growth cones over the longest possible distances, and illustrate that polarized cell behavior might arise as an adaptation to slowly varying environments. Together our results provide closed-form predictions for variations in chemotactic performance over a wide range of gradient conditions.},

	Abstract = {The self-organizing learning algorithm of Kohonen and most of its extensions are controlled by two learning parameters, the learning coefficient and the width of the neighborhood function, which have to be chosen empirically because neither rules nor methods for their calculation exist. Consequently, often time-consuming parameter studies precede neighborhood-preserving feature maps of the learning data. To circumvent those lengthy numerical studies, this article describes the learning process by a state-space model in order to use the linear Kalman filter algorithm training the feature maps. Then the Kalman filter equations calculate the learning coefficient online during the training, while the width of the neighborhood function needs to be estimated by a second extended Kalman filter for the process of neighborhood preservation. The performance of the Kalman filter implementation is demonstrated on toy problems as well as on a crab classification problem. The results of crab classification are compared to those of generative topographic mapping, an alternative method to the self-organizing feature map.},

This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.},

	Abstract = {We study the neural field equations introduced by Chossat and Faugeras to model the representation and the processing of image edges and textures in the hypercolumns of the cortical area V1. The key entity, the structure tensor, intrinsically lives in a {non-Euclidean}, in effect hyperbolic, space. Its spatio-temporal behaviour is governed by nonlinear integro-differential equations defined on the Poincare disc model of the two-dimensional hyperbolic space. Using methods from the theory of functional analysis we show the existence and uniqueness of a solution of these equations. In the case of stationary, i.e. time independent, solutions we perform a stability analysis which yields important results on their behavior. We also present an original study, based on {non-Euclidean}, hyperbolic, analysis, of a spatially localised bump solution in a limiting case. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical {simulations.AMS} subject classifications: {30F45}, {33C05}, {34A12}, {34D20}, {34D23}, {34G20}, {37M05}, {43A85}, {44A35}, {45G10}, {51M10}, {92B20}, {92C20}.},

@article{Chatterjee11,
	Abstract = {{\\\\sl Escherichia coli} ({\\\\sl E. coli}) bacteria govern their trajectories by switching between running and tumbling modes as a function of the nutrient concentration they experienced in the past. At short time one observes a drift of the bacterial population, while at long time one observes accumulation in high-nutrient regions. Recent work has viewed chemotaxis as a compromise between drift toward favorable regions and accumulation in favorable regions. A number of earlier studies assume that a bacterium resets its memory at tumbles -- a fact not borne out by experiment -- and make use of approximate coarse-grained descriptions. Here, we revisit the problem of chemotaxis without resorting to any memory resets. We find that when bacteria respond to the environment in a non-adaptive manner, chemotaxis is generally dominated by diffusion, whereas when bacteria respond in an adaptive manner, chemotaxis is dominated by a bias in the motion. In the adaptive case, favorable drift occurs together with favorable accumulation. We derive our results from detailed simulations and a variety of analytical arguments. In particular, we introduce a new coarse-grained description of chemotaxis as biased diffusion, and we discuss the way it departs from older coarse-grained descriptions.},

@article{Hines11,
	Abstract = {For neural network simulations on parallel machines, interprocessor spike communication can be a significant portion of the total simulation time. The performance of several spike exchange methods using a Blue {Gene/P} ({BG}/P) supercomputer has been tested with 8-128 K cores using randomly connected networks of up to 32 M cells with 1 k connections per cell and 4 M cells with 10 k connections per cell, i.e., on the order of 4·10(10) connections (K is 1024, M is 1024(2), and k is 1000). The spike exchange methods used are the standard Message Passing Interface ({MPI}) collective, {MPI\_Allgather}, and several variants of the non-blocking Multisend method either implemented via non-blocking {MPI\_Isend}, or exploiting the possibility of very low overhead direct memory access ({DMA}) communication available on the {BG}/P. In all cases, the worst performing method was that using {MPI\_Isend} due to the high overhead of initiating a spike communication. The two best performing methods-the persistent Multisend method using the {Record-Replay} feature of the Deep Computing Messaging Framework {DCMF\_Multicast}; and a two-phase multisend in which a {DCMF\_Multicast} is used to first send to a subset of phase one destination cores, which then pass it on to their subset of phase two destination cores-had similar performance with very low overhead for the initiation of spike communication. Departure from ideal scaling for the Multisend methods is almost completely due to load imbalance caused by the large variation in number of cells that fire on each processor in the interval between synchronization. Spike exchange time itself is negligible since transmission overlaps with computation and is handled by a {DMA} controller. We conclude that ideal performance scaling will be ultimately limited by imbalance between incoming processor spikes between synchronization intervals. Thus, counterintuitively, maximization of load balance requires that the distribution of cells on processors should not reflect neural net architecture but be randomly distributed so that sets of cells which are burst firing together should be on different processors with their targets on as large a set of processors as possible.},

@article{Muller11,
	Abstract = {In the hippocampus and the neocortex, the coupling between local field potential ({LFP}) oscillations and the spiking of single neurons can be highly precise, across neuronal populations and cell types. Spike phase (i.e., the spike time with respect to a reference oscillation) is known to carry reliable information, both with phase-locking behavior and with more complex phase relationships, such as phase precession. How this precision is achieved by neuronal populations, whose membrane properties and total input may be quite heterogeneous, is nevertheless unknown. In this note, we investigate a simple mechanism for learning precise {LFP}-to-spike coupling in feed-forward networks - the reliable, periodic modulation of presynaptic firing rates during oscillations, coupled with spike-timing dependent plasticity. When oscillations are within the biological range (2-150 Hz), firing rates of the inputs change on a timescale highly relevant to spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}). Through analytic and computational methods, we find points of stable phase-locking for a neuron with plastic input synapses. These points correspond to precise phase-locking behavior in the feed-forward network. The location of these points depends on the oscillation frequency of the inputs, the {STDP} time constants, and the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the {STDP} rule. For a given input oscillation, the balance of potentiation and de-potentiation in the {STDP} rule is the critical parameter that determines the phase at which an output neuron will learn to spike. These findings are robust to changes in intrinsic post-synaptic properties. Finally, we discuss implications of this mechanism for stable learning of spike-timing in the hippocampus.},

@article{Crouzet11a,
	Abstract = {Recent experimental work has demonstrated the existence of extremely rapid saccades toward faces in natural scenes that can be initiated only 100\^{a}ms after image onset (Crouzet et al., 2010). These ultra-rapid saccades constitute a major challenge to current models of processing in the visual system because they do not seem to leave enough time for even a single feed-forward pass through the ventral stream. Here we explore the possibility that the information required to trigger these very fast saccades could be extracted very early on in visual processing using relatively low-level amplitude spectrum ({AS}) information in the Fourier domain. Experiment 1 showed that {AS} normalization can significantly alter face-detection performance. However, a decrease of performance following {AS} normalization does not alone prove that {AS}-based information is used (Gaspar and Rousselet, 2009). In Experiment 2, following the Gaspar and Rousselet paper, we used a swapping procedure to clarify the role of {AS} information in fast object detection. Our experiment is composed of three conditions: (i) original images, (ii) category swapped, in which the face image has the {AS} of a vehicle, and the vehicle has the {AS} of a face, and (iii) identity swapped, where the face has the {AS} of another face image, and the vehicle has the {AS} of another vehicle image. The results showed very similar levels of performance in the original and identity swapped conditions, and a clear drop in the category swapped condition. This result demonstrates that, in the early temporal window offered by the saccadic choice task, the visual saccadic system does indeed rely on low-level {AS} information in order to rapidly detect faces. This sort of crude diagnostic information could potentially be derived very early on in the visual system, possibly as early as V1 and V2.},

	Abstract = {A computational study into the motion perception dynamics of a multistable psychophysics stimulus is presented. A diagonally drifting grating viewed through a square aperture is can be perceived as moving in the actual grating direction or in line with the aperture edges (horizontally or vertically). The different percepts are the product of interplay between ambiguous contour cues and specific terminator cues. We present a dynamical model of motion integration that performs direction selection for such a stimulus and link the different percepts to coexisting steady-states of the underlying equations. We apply the powerful tools of bifurcation analysis and numerical continuation to study the changes to the model's solution structure under the variation of parameters. Indeed, we apply these tools in a systematic way, taking into account biological and mathematical constraints, in order to fix model parameters. A region of parameter space is identified for which the model reproduces the qualitative behaviour observed in experiments. The temporal dynamics of motion integration are studied within this region; specifically, the effect of varying the stimulus gain is studied, which allows for qualitative predictions to be made.},

	Abstract = {Traditionally, research on vision focused on its role in perception and our cognitive life. Except for the study of eye movements, which have been regarded as an information-seeking adjunct to visual perception, little attention was paid to the way in which vision is used to control our actions, particularly the movements of our hands and limbs. Over the last 25 years all of that has changed. Researchers are now actively investigating the way in which vision is used to control a broad range of complex goal-directed action -- and are exploring the neural substrates of that control. A new model of the functional organization of the visual pathways in the primate cerebral cortex has emerged, one that posits a division of labor between vision-for-action (the dorsal stream) and vision-for-perception (the ventral stream). In this review, I examine some of the seminal work on the role of vision in the control of manual prehension and on the visual cues that play a critical role in this important human skill. I then review the key evidence for the perception--action model, particularly with reference to the role of the dorsal stream in the control of manual prehension, touching on recent work that both reinforces and challenges this account of the organization of the visual system.},

Here we address the human development of long-range connectivity in primary visual and motor cortices, using well-established behavioral measures--a Contour Integration test and a Finger-tapping task--that have been shown to be related to these specific primary areas, and the long-range neural connectivity within those. Possible confounding factors, such as different task requirements (complexity, cognitive load) are eliminated by using these tasks in a learning paradigm. We find that there is a temporal lag between the developmental timing of primary sensory vs. motor areas with an advantage of visual development; we also confirm that human development is very slow in both cases, and that there is a retained capacity for practice induced plastic changes in adults. This pattern of results seems to point to human-specific development of the "canonical circuits" of primary sensory and motor cortices, probably reflecting the ecological requirements of human life.},

@article{Fernando10,
	Abstract = {We propose that replication (with mutation) of patterns of neuronal activity can occur within the brain using known neurophysiological processes. Thereby evolutionary algorithms implemented by neuro- nal circuits can play a role in cognition. Replication of structured neuronal representations is assumed in several cognitive architectures. Replicators overcome some limitations of selectionist models of neuronal search. Hebbian learning is combined with replication to structure exploration on the basis of associations learned in the past. Neuromodulatory gating of sets of bistable neurons allows patterns of activation to be copied with mutation. If the probability of copying a set is related to the utility of that set, then an evolutionary algorithm can be implemented at rapid timescales in the brain. Populations of neuronal replicators can undertake a more rapid and stable search than can be achieved by serial modification of a single solution. Hebbian learning added to neuronal replication allows a powerful structuring of variability capable of learning the location of a global optimum from multiple previously visited local optima. Replication of solutions can solve the problem of catastrophic forgetting in the stability-plasticity dilemma. In short, neuronal replication is essential to explain several features of flexible cognition. Predictions are made for the experimental validation of the neuronal replicator hypothesis. We propose that replication (with mutation) of patterns of neuronal activity can occur within the brain using known neurophysiological processes. Thereby evolutionary algorithms implemented by neuro- nal circuits can play a role in cognition. Replication of structured neuronal representations is assumed in several cognitive architectures. Replicators overcome some limitations of selectionist models of neuronal search. Hebbian learning is combined with replication to structure exploration on the basis of associations learned in the past. Neuromodulatory gating of sets of bistable neurons allows patterns of activation to be copied with mutation. If the probability of copying a set is related to the utility of that set, then an evolutionary algorithm can be implemented at rapid timescales in the brain.

@article{Pellionisz85,
	Abstract = {Here we present an elaboration and a quantitative example for a hypothetical neuronal process, implementing what we refer to as the metaorganization principle. This process allows the internalization of external (body) geometries into the central nervous system ({CNS}) and a reciprocal and equally important action of the {CNS} geometry on the external (body) geometry. The hypothesis is based on the distinction, within the {CNS}, between covariant sensory and contravariant motor vectorial expressions of the extrinsic geometry. These sensory and motor expressions, given in natural co-ordinate systems, are transformed from one to the other by a neuronal network which acts as a metric tensor. The metric tensor determines the relationship of these two expressions and thus comprises the functional geometry of the system. The emergence through metaorganization of networks that implement such metric function is viewed as the result of interactions between the covariant motor execution which generates a physical action on the external world (via the musculoskeletal system) and the covariant sensory proprioception which measures the effect of such motor output. In this transformation of contravariants to covariants by the physical geometry of the motor system, a covariant metric tensor is expressed implicitly. However, co-ordinated motor action requires its dual tensor (the contravariant metric) which is assembled in the {CNS} based on the metaorganization principle, i.e. the ability of {CNS} and external geometries to mold one another. The two metric transformations acting on each other detect error signals whenever the match of the physical and functional geometries is imperfect. Such error signals are utilized by the metaorganization process to improve the match between the two metrics, so that with use the internal representation becomes increasingly homeometric with the geometry of the external world. The proposed physical process by which the metaorganization principle is implemented is based on oscillatory reverberation. If covariant proprioception is used as a recurrent signal to the motor apparatus, as if it were a contravariant motor expression, then reverberations at their steady-state yield the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the system. The stored eigenvectors and eigenvalues can serve, respectively, as a means for the genesis of a metric (in the form of its spectral representation) with the given eigenvectors and as a means of comparing the eigenvalues that are implicit in the external body geometry and those of the internal {metric.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

The cortical activity is described using a linear superposition of waves traveling with different speeds. This model improves the quality of the wave detection and still respects the previous approaches, as it integrates several biologically plausible constraints: 1) separability of the sources in terms of cortical location; 2) separability of the waves in terms of propagation speed, and 3) additivity of the depolarizing effects of the waves. Under these assumptions, a traveling component analysis algorithm performs a full separation of the set of waves and recovers the locations of the neural sources.

	Abstract = {The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share a hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to {non-Euclidean} domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping '' pictures''. We hope that this paper will contribute to the appreciation and apprehension of a stream of current research directions in image understanding.},

	Abstract = {This paper studies the properties of L1-analysis regularization for the resolution of linear inverse problems. Most previous works consider sparse synthesis priors where the sparsity is measured as the L1 norm of the coefficients that synthesize the signal in a given dictionary. In contrast, the more general analysis regularization minimizes the L1 norm of the correlations between the signal and the atoms in the dictionary. The corresponding variational problem includes several well-known regularizations such as the discrete total variation and the fused lasso. We first prove that a solution of analysis regularization is a piecewise affine function of the observations. Similarly, it is a piecewise affine function of the regularization parameter. This allows us to compute the degrees of freedom associated to sparse analysis estimators. Another contribution gives a sufficient condition to ensure that a signal is the unique solution of the analysis regularization when there is no noise in the observations. The same criterion ensures the robustness of the sparse analysis solution to a small noise in the observations. Our last contribution defines a stronger sufficient condition that ensures robustness to an arbitrary bounded noise. In the special case of synthesis regularization, our contributions recover already known results, that are hence generalized to the analysis setting. We illustrate these theoritical results on practical examples to study the robustness of the total variation and the fused lasso regularizations.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a generative model for textures that uses a local sparse description of the image content. This model enforces the sparsity of the expansion of local texture patches on adapted atomic elements. The analysis of a given texture within this framework performs the sparse coding of all the patches of the texture into the dictionary of atoms. Conversely, the synthesis of a new texture is performed by solving an optimization problem that seeks for a texture whose patches are sparse in the dictionary. This paper explores several strategies to choose this dictionary. A set of hand crafted dictionaries composed of edges, oscillations, lines or crossings elements allows to synthesize synthetic images with geometric features. Another option is to define the dictionary as the set of all the patches of an input exemplar. This leads to computer graphics methods for synthesis and shares some similarities with non-local means filtering. The last method we explore learns the dictionary by an optimization process that maximizes the sparsity of a set of exemplar patches. Applications of all these methods to texture synthesis, inpainting and classification shows the efficiency of the proposed texture model.},

@article{Wei08,
	Abstract = {The quality and speed of most texture synthesis algorithms depend on a {2D} input sample that is small and contains enough texture variations. However, little research exists on how to acquire such sample. For homogeneous patterns this can be achieved via manual cropping, but no adequate solution exists for inhomogeneous or globally varying textures, i.e. patterns that are local but not stationary, such as rusting over an iron statue with appearance conditioned on varying moisture levels. We present inverse texture synthesis to address this issue. Our inverse synthesis runs in the opposite direction with respect to traditional forward synthesis: given a large globally varying texture, our algorithm automatically produces a small texture compaction that best summarizes the original. This small compaction can be used to reconstruct the original texture or to re-synthesize new textures under user-supplied controls. More important, our technique allows real-time synthesis of globally varying textures on a {GPU}, where the texture memory is usually too small for large textures. We propose an optimization framework for inverse texture synthesis, ensuring that each input region is properly encoded in the output compaction. Our optimization process also automatically computes orientation fields for anisotropic textures containing both low- and high-frequency regions, a situation difficult to handle via existing techniques.},

	Abstract = {Presents a theoretically very simple, yet efficient, multiresolution approach to gray-scale and rotation invariant texture classification based on local binary patterns and nonparametric discrimination of sample and prototype distributions. The method is based on recognizing that certain local binary patterns, termed "uniform," are fundamental properties of local image texture and their occurrence histogram is proven to be a very powerful texture feature. We derive a generalized gray-scale and rotation invariant operator presentation that allows for detecting the "uniform" patterns for any quantization of the angular space and for any spatial resolution and presents a method for combining multiple operators for multiresolution analysis. The proposed approach is very robust in terms of gray-scale variations since the operator is, by definition, invariant against any monotonic transformation of the gray scale. Another advantage is computational simplicity as the operator can be realized with a few operations in a small neighborhood and a lookup table. Experimental results demonstrate that good discrimination can be achieved with the occurrence statistics of simple rotation invariant local binary patterns},

@article{Haralick73,
	Abstract = {Texture is one of the important characteristics used in identifying objects or regions of interest in an image, whether the image be a photomicrograph, an aerial photograph, or a satellite image. This paper describes some easily computable textural features based on gray-tone spatial dependancies, and illustrates their application in category-identification tasks of three different kinds of image data: photomicrographs of five kinds of sandstones, 1:20 000 panchromatic aerial photographs of eight land-use categories, and Earth Resources Technology Satellite ({ERTS}) multispecial imagery containing seven land-use categories. We use two kinds of decision rules: one for which the decision regions are convex polyhedra (a piecewise linear decision rule), and one for which the decision regions are rectangular parallelpipeds (a min-max decision rule). In each experiment the data set was divided into two parts, a training set and a test set. Test set identification accuracy is 89 percent for the photomicrographs, 82 percent for the aerial photographic imagery, and 83 percent for the satellite imagery. These results indicate that the easily computable textural features probably have a general applicability for a wide variety of image-classification applications.},

A level set formulation is used to model the boundaries of the image regions and a new Multilabel Fast Marching is introduced for the evolution of the region contours toward the segmentation result. Statistical tests are performed to yield an initial estimate of high-confidence subsets of the image regions. Furthermore, the velocities for the propagation of the region contours are defined in accordance with the a posteriori probability of the respective regions, leading to the Bayesian Level Set methodology described in this paper. Typical segmentation problems are considered and experimental results are given to illustrate the robustness of the method against noise and its performance in precise region boundary localization.},

	Abstract = {We propose a Bayesian framework for representing and recognizing local image motion in terms of two basic models: translational motion and motion boundaries. Motion boundaries are represented using a non-linear generative model that explicitly encodes the orientation of the boundary, the velocities on either side, the motion of the occluding edge over time, and the appearance/disappearance of pixels at the boundary. We represent the posterior probability distribution over the model parameters given the image data using discrete samples. This distribution is propagated over time using a particle filtering algorithm. To efficiently represent such a high-dimensional space we initialize samples using the responses of a low-level motion discontinuity detector. The formulation and computational model provide a general probabilistic framework for motion estimation with multiple, non-linear, models.},

	Abstract = {The objectives of this research were to estimate the ability of chemical analysis, cooking properties, sensory evaluation and instrumental texture assays as descriptive quality parameters, and to evaluate the association between sensory and instrumental measurements on commercial pasta samples. Five commercial samples, Com1 to Com5, were analyzed. Moisture, protein and ash contents were determined from raw materials, while cooking loss, water absorption and leached amylose were measured in cooked samples. Color parameters (L*, a* and b*) were determined spectrophotometrically and color scores were calculated from raw and cooked samples. Three instrumental texture assays by a texture analyzer ({TA}-{xT2i}) and seven sensory parameters were evaluated. Chemical analysis, cooking properties, sensory evaluation and texture measurement were found to be sensitive quality parameters. From the analysis of the results, Com1 showed the best quality. A significant relationship between the sensory and instrumental measurements according to Pearson correlation and the principal component analysis was also observed. {PRACTICAL} {APPLICATIONS} In this work, the quality of different commercial pastas was assessed by means of chemical analysis, cooking properties, sensory evaluation and instrumental texture. The goal of this study was to identify the most important determinations related to pasta quality, and it allowed the establishment of the relationship between the sensory properties and texture measurements.},

@article{El-Shamayleh11,
	Abstract = {Human and macaque observers can detect and discriminate visual forms defined by differences in texture. The neurophysiological correlates of visual texture perception are not well understood and have not been studied extensively at the single-neuron level in the primate brain. We used a novel family of texture patterns to measure the selectivity of neurons in extrastriate cortical area V2 of the macaque (Macaca nemestrina, Macaca fascicularis) for the orientation of texture-defined form, and to distinguish responses to luminance- and texture-defined form. Most V2 cells were selective for the orientation of luminance-defined form; they signaled the orientation of the component gratings that made up the texture patterns but not the overall pattern orientation. In some cells, these luminance responses were modulated by the direction or orientation of the texture envelope, suggesting an interaction of luminance and texture signals. We found little evidence for a '' cue-invariant'' representation in monkey V2. Few cells showed selectivity for the orientation of texture-defined form; they signaled the orientation of the texture patterns and not that of the component gratings. Small datasets recorded in monkey V1 and cat area 18 showed qualitatively similar patterns of results. Consistent with human functional imaging studies, our findings suggest that signals related to texture-defined form in primate cortex are most salient in areas downstream of V2. V2 may still provide the foundation for texture perception, through the interaction of luminance- and texture-based signals.},

@article{Khellah11,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new approach to extract global image features for the purpose of texture classification. The proposed texture features are obtained by generating an estimated global map representing the measured intensity similarity between any given image pixel and its surrounding neighbors within a certain window. The intensity similarity map is an average representation of the texture-image dominant neighborhood similarity. The estimated dominant neighborhood similarity is robust to noise and referred to as image dominant neighborhood structure. The global rotation-invariant features are then extracted from the generated image dominant neighborhood structure. Features obtained from the local binary patterns ({LBPs}) are then extracted in order to supply additional local texture features to the generated features from the dominant neighborhood structure. Both features complement each other. The experimental results on representative texture databases show that the proposed method is robust to noise and can achieve significant improvement in terms of the obtained classification accuracy in comparison to the {LBP} method. In addition, the method classification accuracy is comparable to the two recent {LBP} extensions: dominant {LBP} and completed {LBP}.},

@article{Ito11,
	Abstract = {During natural vision, primates perform frequent saccadic eye movements, allowing only a narrow time window for processing the visual information at each location. Individual neurons may contribute only with a few spikes to the visual processing during each fixation, suggesting precise spike timing as a relevant mechanism for information processing. We recently found in V1 of monkeys freely viewing natural images, that fixation-related spike synchronization occurs at the early phase of the rate response after fixation-onset, suggesting a specific role of the first response spikes in V1. Here, we show that there are strong local field potential ({LFP}) modulations locked to the onset of saccades, which continue into the successive fixation periods. Visually induced spikes, in particular the first spikes after the onset of a fixation, are locked to a specific epoch of the {LFP} modulation. We suggest that the modulation of neural excitability, which is reflected by the saccade-related {LFP} changes, serves as a corollary signal enabling precise timing of spikes in V1 and thereby providing a mechanism for spike synchronization.},

	Abstract = {We investigate the spatial correlations of orientation and color information in natural images. We find that the correlation of orientation information falls off rapidly with increasing distance, while color information is more highly correlated over longer distances. We show that orientation and color information are statistically independent in natural images and that the spatial correlation of jointly encoded orientation and color information decays faster than that of color alone. Our findings suggest that: (a) orientation and color information should be processed in separate channels and (b) the organization of cortical color and orientation selectivity at low spatial frequencies is a reflection of the cortical adaptation to the statistical structure of the visual world. These findings are in agreement with biological observations, as form and color are thought to be represented by different classes of neurons in the primary visual cortex, and the receptive fields of color-selective neurons are larger than those of orientation-selective neurons. The agreement between our findings and biological observations supports the ecological theory of perception.},

@article{Wilson11,
	Abstract = {The place theory proposed by Jeffress (1948) is still the dominant model of how the brain represents the movement of sensory stimuli between sensory receptors. According to the place theory, delays in signalling between neurons, dependent on the distances between them, compensate for time differences in the stimulation of sensory receptors. Hence the location of neurons, activated by the coincident arrival of multiple signals, reports the stimulus movement velocity. Despite its generality, most evidence for the place theory has been provided by studies of the auditory system of auditory specialists like the barn owl, but in the study of mammalian auditory systems the evidence is inconclusive. We ask to what extent the somatosensory systems of tactile specialists like rats and mice use distance dependent delays between neurons to compute the motion of tactile stimuli between the facial whiskers (or 'vibrissae'). We present a model in which synaptic inputs evoked by whisker deflections arrive at neurons in layer 2/3 (L2/3) somatosensory 'barrel' cortex at different times. The timing of synaptic inputs to each neuron depends on its location relative to sources of input in layer 4 (L4) that represent stimulation of each whisker. Constrained by the geometry and timing of projections from L4 to L2/3, the model can account for a range of experimentally measured responses to two-whisker stimuli. Consistent with that data, responses of model neurons located between the barrels to paired stimulation of two whiskers are greater than the sum of the responses to either whisker input alone. The model predicts that for neurons located closer to either barrel these supralinear responses are tuned for longer inter-whisker stimulation intervals, yielding a topographic map for the inter-whisker deflection interval across the surface of L2/3. This map constitutes a neural place code for the relative timing of sensory stimuli.},

	Abstract = {The dorsal striatum is crucial for the acquisition and consolidation of instrumental behaviour, but the underlying computations and internal dynamics remain elusive. To address this issue, we combined a model of key computations supporting decision-making during instrumental learning with human behavioural and functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) data. The results showed that the associative and sensorimotor dorsal striatum host complementary computations that, we suggest, may differentially support goal-directed and habitual processes. The anterior caudate nucleus integrates information about performance and cognitive control demands, whereas the putamen tracks how likely the conditioning stimuli lead to correct response. Contrary to current models, the putamen is recruited during initial acquisition. As the exploratory phase proceeds, the relative contribution of the caudate nucleus becomes dominant over the putamen. During early consolidation, caudate nucleus and putamen settle to asymptotic values and share control. We then investigated how dorsal striatal computations may affect decision-making. We found that portion of reaction times' variance parallels the combined cost associated with the dorsal striatal computations. Overall, our findings provide a deeper insight into the functional heterogeneity within the dorsal striatum and suggest that the dynamic interplay between caudate nucleus and putamen, rather than their serial recruitment, underlies the acquisition and early consolidation of instrumental behaviours.

@article{Patel10,
	Abstract = {Despite several attempts to define retinotopic maps in the macaque lateral intraparietal area ({LIP}) using histological, electrophysiological, and neuroimaging methods, the degree to which this area is topographically organized remains controversial. We recorded blood oxygenation level-dependent signals with functional {MRI} from two macaques performing a difficult visual search task on stimuli presented at the fovea or in the periphery of the visual field. The results revealed the presence of a single topographic representation of the contralateral hemifield in the ventral subdivision of the {LIP} ({LIPv}) in both hemispheres of both monkeys. Also, a foveal representation was localized in rostral {LIPv} rather than in dorsal {LIP} ({LIPd}) as previous experiments had suggested. Finally, both {LIPd} and {LIPv} responded only to contralateral stimuli. In contrast, human studies have reported multiple topographic maps in intraparietal cortex and robust responses to ipsilateral stimuli. These blood oxygenation level-dependent functional {MRI} results provide clear evidence for the topographic organization of macaque {LIP} that complements the results of previous electrophysiology studies, and also reveal some unexpected characteristics of this organization that have eluded these previous studies. The results also delineate organizational differences between {LIPv} and {LIPd}, providing support for these two histologically defined areas may subserve different visuospatial functions. Finally, these findings point to potential evolutionary differences in functional organization with human posterior parietal cortex.},

@article{Yger11,
	Abstract = {The relationship between the dynamics of neural networks and their patterns of connectivity is far from clear, despite its importance for understanding functional properties. Here, we have studied sparsely-connected networks of conductance-based integrate-and-fire ({IF}) neurons with balanced excitatory and inhibitory connections and with finite axonal propagation speed. We focused on the genesis of states with highly irregular spiking activity and synchronous firing patterns at low rates, called slow Synchronous Irregular ({SI}) states. In such balanced networks, we examined the "macroscopic" properties of the spiking activity, such as ensemble correlations and mean firing rates, for different intracortical connectivity profiles ranging from randomly connected networks to networks with Gaussian-distributed local connectivity. We systematically computed the distance-dependent correlations at the extracellular (spiking) and intracellular (membrane potential) levels between randomly assigned pairs of neurons. The main finding is that such properties, when they are averaged at a macroscopic scale, are invariant with respect to the different connectivity patterns, provided the excitatory-inhibitory balance is the same. In particular, the same correlation structure holds for different connectivity profiles. In addition, we examined the response of such networks to external input, and found that the correlation landscape can be modulated by the mean level of synchrony imposed by the external drive. This modulation was found again to be independent of the external connectivity profile. We conclude that first and second-order "mean-field" statistics of such networks do not depend on the details of the connectivity at a microscopic scale. This study is an encouraging step toward a mean-field description of topological neuronal networks.},

@article{Kline04,
	Abstract = {In stroboscopic conditions----such as motion pictures----rotating objects may appear to rotate in the reverse direction due to under-sampling (aliasing). A seemingly similar phenomenon occurs in constant sunlight, which has been taken as evidence that the visual system processes discrete '' snapshots'' of the outside world. But if snapshots are indeed taken of the visual field, then when a rotating drum appears to transiently reverse direction, its mirror image should always appeared to reverse direction simultaneously. Contrary to this hypothesis, we found that when observers watched a rotating drum and its mirror image, almost all illusory motion reversals occurred for only one image at a time. This result indicates that the motion reversal illusion cannot be explained by snapshots of the visual field. The same result is found when the two images are presented within one visual hemifield, further ruling out the possibility that discrete sampling of the visual field occurs separately in each hemisphere. The frequency distribution of illusory reversal durations approximates a gamma distribution, suggesting perceptual rivalry as a better explanation for illusory motion reversal. After adaptation of motion detectors coding for the correct direction, the activity of motion-sensitive neurons coding for motion in the reverse direction may intermittently become dominant and drive the perception of motion.},

Teil B 12, 447 (1957)], is an opponent system of two mirror-image subunits. Each subunit receives inputs from two spatiotemporal filters (receptive fields), multiplies the filter outputs, and temporally integrates the product. Subunit outputs are algebraically subtracted to yield {ERD} output. {ERD}'s can correctly indicate direction of motion of drifting sine waves of any spatial and temporal frequency. Here we prove that with a careful choice of either temporal or spatial filters, the subunits can themselves become quite similar or equivalent to the whole {ERD}; with suitably chosen filters, the {ERD} is equivalent to an elaborated version of a motion detector proposed by Watson and Ahumada [{NASA} Tech. Memo. 84352 (1983)]; and for every choice of filters, the {ERD} is fully equivalent to the detector proposed by Adelson and Bergen [J. Opt. Soc. Am. A 2, 284-299 (1985)]. Some equivalences between the motion detection (in x, t) by {ERD}'s and spatial pattern detection (in x, y) are demonstrated. The responses of the {ERD} and its variants to drifting sinusoidal gratings, to other sinusoidally modulated stimuli (on-off gratings, counterphase flicker), and to combinations of sinusoids are derived and compared with data. {ERD} responses to two-frame motion displays are derived, and several new experimental predictions are tested {experimentally.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 250 {WORDS})},

	Abstract = {Unlike humans, numerous animals are differentially sensitive to the vector orientation of linearly polarized light. However as early as 1844 Haidinger noted that weak blue-yellow brushes appear, centered on the fovea, when the sky is observed through a slowly rotating polarizer. Different models have been proposed to try to understand this phenomenon, but the precise mechanism remains unknown and the polarization unexploited. We suggest that when Fresnel's laws are applied to the unguided oblique rays, that the cylindrical geometry of the blue cones in the fovea along with their distribution induces an extrinsic dichroism and could explain why the human eye is sensitive to polarization. We have constructed an artificial eye model system using the same laws and were able to photograph the appearance of entoptic-like blue-dark brushes, confirming the observations and our mathematical simulations. Moreover, our in vivo and in vitro tests show that in addition to the usual 3s fading time measured using a stationary stimulus, there exists for this entoptic image a short extra creating and erasing time of about 0.1s, using a dynamical stimulus. We have also found that, surprisingly, the rotating pattern is more regular and symmetrical with one of our two eyes around a more circular blue cone-free area, the dominant eye. Our results suggest that the polarization sense can provide important information in many areas that remain to be explored. Copyright 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {
                Robust coding has been proposed as a solution to the problem of minimizing decoding error in the presence of neural noise. Many real-world problems, however, have degradation in the input signal, not just in neural representations. This generalized problem is more relevant to biological sensory coding where internal noise arises from limited neural precision and external noise from distortion of sensory signal such as blurring and phototransduction noise. In this note, we show that the optimal linear encoder for this problem can be decomposed exactly into two serial processes that can be optimized separately. One is Wiener filtering, which optimally compensates for input degradation. The other is robust coding, which best uses the available representational capacity for signal transmission with a noisy population of linear neurons. We also present spectral analysis of the decomposition that characterizes how the reconstruction error is minimized under different input signal spectra, types and amounts of degradation, degrees of neural precision, and neural population sizes.

	Abstract = {The perceived direction of a moving line changes, often markedly, when viewed through an aperture. Although several explanations of this remarkable effect have been proposed, these accounts typically focus on the percepts elicited by a particular type of aperture and offer no biological rationale. Here, we test the hypothesis that to contend with the inherently ambiguous nature of motion stimuli the perceived direction of objects moving behind apertures of different shapes is determined by a wholly empirical strategy of visual processing. An analysis of moving line stimuli generated by objects projected through apertures shows that the directions of motion subjects report in psychophysical testing is accounted for by the frequency of occurrence of the {2D} directions of stimuli generated by simulated {3D} sources. The completeness of these predictions supports the conclusion that the direction of perceived motion is fully determined by accumulated behavioral experience with sources whose physical motions cannot be conveyed by image sequences as such.},

@article{Scholl99,
	Abstract = {In three experiments, subjects attempted to track multiple items as they moved independently and unpredictably about a display. Performance was not impaired when the items were briefly (but completely) occluded at various times during their motion, suggesting that occlusion is taken into account when computing enduring perceptual objecthood. Unimpaired performance required the presence of accretion and deletion cues along fixed contours at the occluding boundaries. Performance was impaired when items were present on the visual field at the same times and to the same degrees as in the occlusion conditions, but disappeared and reappeared in ways which did not implicate the presence of occluding surfaces (e.g., by imploding and exploding into and out of existence instead of accreting and deleting along a fixed contour). Unimpaired performance did not require visible occluders (i.e., Michotte's tunnel effect) or globally consistent occluder positions. We discuss implications of these results for theories of objecthood in visual attention. Copyright 1999 Academic Press.},

@article{Pylyshyn88a,
	Abstract = {There is considerable evidence that visual attention is concentrated at a single locus in the visual field, and that this locus can be moved independent of eye movements. Two studies are reported which suggest that, while certain aspects of attention require that locations be scanned serially, at least one operation may be carried out in parallel across several independent loci in the visual field. That is the operation of indexing features and tracking their identity. The studies show that: (a) subjects are able to track a subset of up to 5 objects in a field of 10 identical randomly-moving objects in order to distinguish a change in a target from a change in a distractor; and (b) when the speed and distance parameters of the display are designed so that, on the basis of some very conservative assumptions about the speed of attention movement and encoding times, the predicted performance of a serial scanning and updating algorithm would not exceed about 40\% accuracy, subjects still manage to do the task with 87\% accuracy. These findings are discussed in relation to an earlier, and independently motivated model of feature-binding--called the {FINST} model--which posits a primitive identity maintenance mechanism that indexes and tracks a limited number of visual objects in parallel. These indexes are hypothesized to serve the function of binding visual features prior to subsequent pattern recognition.},

@article{Xing00,
	Abstract = {The perceived contrast of a central stimulus can be decreased (surround suppression) or increased (surround facilitation) by the presence of surround stimuli. In this report we examined center-surround interactions in foveal and peripheral vision using contrast-matching tasks. We found that: (1) surround suppression became markedly stronger as the center-surround stimulus was moved toward the periphery; (2) surround facilitation diminished in the periphery; and (3) the suppression in the periphery was less orientation- and frequency-specific than that in the fovea, so that significant suppression was induced even when the central and surround gratings had very different orientations and spatial frequencies. The different center-surround interactions in the fovea and periphery can not be accounted for by cortical magnification, suggesting that center-surround interactions in the fovea and periphery are incommensurable and play different functional roles in human image processing.},

	Abstract = {An object recognition system has been developed that uses a new class of local image features. The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or {3D} {projection.These} features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple {scales.The} keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbor indexing method that identifies candidate object matches. Final verification of each match is achieved by finding a low-residual least-squares solution for the unknown model parameters. Experimental results show that robust object recognition can be achieved in cluttered partially-occluded images with a computation time of under 2 seconds.},

These illusory reversals have been taken as evidence that part of the motion perception system samples its inputs as a series of discrete snapshots \^{a}although other explanations of the phenomenon have been proposed, that rely on the spurious activation of low-level motion detectors in early visual areas. We have hypothesized that the right inferior parietal lobe (\^{a}when\^{a} pathway) plays a critical role in timing perceptual events relative to one another, and thus we examined the role of the right parietal lobe in the generation of this \^{a}continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion\^{a} ({c-WWI}). Consistent with our hypothesis, we found that the illusion was effectively weakened following disruption of right, but not left, parietal regions by low frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (1 Hz, 10 min). These results were independent of whether the motion stimulus was shown in the left or the right visual field. Thus, the {c-WWI} appears to depend on higher-order attentional mechanisms that are supported by the \^{a}when\^{a} pathway of the right parietal lobe.},

@article{VanRullen06,
	Abstract = {Continuously moving objects sometimes appear to spontaneously reverse their motion direction. The mechanisms underlying this bistable phenomenon (the "continuous wagon wheel illusion") are heavily debated, but one interpretation suggests that motion information is perceived in discrete episodes at a rate between 10 and 15 Hz. Here, we asked observers to report the perceived direction of a continuously rotating wheel while 32-channel electroencephalogram ({EEG}) was recorded. We then separated periods of perceived true from illusory (reversed) motion and compared the {EEG} power spectrum under these two perceptually distinct yet physically identical conditions. The only reliable difference was observed approximately 13 Hz over centroparietal electrodes, independent of the temporal frequency of the wheel. Thus, it is likely to reflect internal processes rather than purely stimulus-driven activity. {EEG} power (13 Hz) decreased before the onset of illusory motion and increased before transitions back to real motion. Using this relationship, it was possible to predict above chance, on a trial-by-trial basis, the direction of the upcoming perceptual transition. These data are compatible with the idea that motion perception occurs in snapshots <100 ms in duration.},

@article{VanRullen06a,
	Abstract = {The occurrence of perceived reversed motion while observers view a periodic, continuously moving stimulus (the "continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion") has been taken as evidence that some aspects of motion perception rely on discrete sampling of visual information. The spatial extent of this sampling is currently under debate. When two separate motion stimuli are viewed simultaneously, the illusion of reversed motion rarely occurs for both objects together: this rules out global sampling of the visual field. The same result holds when the objects are superimposed by transparency: this argues against location-based sampling. Here we show that the sampling is in fact object-based: we use a rotating ring stimulus split in two halves. When the two halves move in opposite directions, appearing to belong to separate objects, perceptual reversals occur in either half at a time, but rarely in both. When the two halves physically move in compatible directions, they generally appear to reverse simultaneously: the illusion keeps the perceptual object united. Rather than the local low-level properties of the motion stimulus (which are comparable in both cases), it is thus the high-level organization of the scene that determines the extent of perceived motion reversals. These results imply that the continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion, and any discrete perceptual sampling that may cause it, is restricted to the object of our attention.},

This method is based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals and does not use voltage-sensitive dyes. Images of the living monkey striate ({VI}) and extrastriate (V2) visual cortex, taken during visual stimulation, were analyzed to yield maps of the distribution of cells with various functional properties. The cytochrome oxidase--rich blobs of V1 and the stripes of V2 were imaged in the living brain. In V2, no ocular dominance organization was seen, while regions of poor orientation tuning colocalized to every other cytochrome oxidase stripe. The orientation tuning of other regions of V2 appeared organized as modules that are larger and more uniform than those in V1.},

@article{Rust05b,
	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly classified as simple or complex based upon their sensitivity to the sign of stimulus contrast. The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

@article{Neri98,
	Abstract = {One of the more stunning examples of the resourcefulness of human vision is the ability to see 'biological motion', which was first shown with an adaptation of earlier cinematic work: illumination of only the joints of a walking person is enough to convey a vivid, compelling impression of human animation, although the percept collapses to a jumble of meaningless lights when the walker stands still. The information is sufficient to discriminate the sex and other details of the walker, and can be interpreted by young infants. Here we measure the ability of the visual system to integrate this type of motion information over space and time, and compare this capacity with that for viewing simple translational motion. Sensitivity to biological motion increases rapidly with the number of illuminated joints, far more rapidly than for simple motion. Furthermore, this information is summed over extended temporal intervals of up to 3 seconds (eight times longer than for simple motion). The steepness of the summation curves indicates that the mechanisms that analyse biological motion do not integrate linearly over space and time with constant efficiency, as may occur for other forms of complex motion, but instead adapt to the nature of the stimulus.},

@article{Jasinschi92,
	Abstract = {Perceptual motion transparency occurs whenever two or more patterns are seen moving at different depth levels, such that we can see one pattern move across the others, and perceptual motion coherence occurs when we see a single motion. We present here a model of perceptual motion transparency and coherence that consists of three stages: (i) measure the normal velocity along contours or the velocity of features such as corners or line end points; (ii) take the intersection, in velocity space, of all possible pairs of constraint lines associated with the normal velocity components; and (iii) combine the results of steps (i) and (ii) in the velocity histogram, which is the plot of the total number of votes for each velocity in velocity space. For two patterns we perceive motion coherence, transparency, or a mixture of both types of motion depending on whether the velocity histogram is unimodal, bimodal, or trimodal. According to our model we perceive motion transparency or coherence depending on the total number of prominent peaks of the velocity histogram, where each peak is located at the position corresponding to the velocity of one of the patterns or of coherent motion. We show that the number of prominent peaks in the velocity histogram depends on the error in the measurement of the local velocity and on the relative orientation of the local velocities along contours; this relative orientation encodes contour shape. Our model differs from current motion theories in that it describes the perception of motion not as a result of local velocity extraction but instead as the result of the integration of local velocity and geometrical shape information across different points of the image and across superimposed patterns. This model allows for the occurrence of mixed motion perception, which arises from the combination of the velocity information associated with motion transparency and coherence. We have tested this model through computational and psychophysical experiments done with line patterns. As a result of these experiments we conjecture that the human visual system may use at least three stages to process image velocity.},

	Abstract = {The small visual area known as {MT} or V5 has played a major role in our understanding of the primate cerebral cortex. This area has been historically important in the concept of cortical processing streams and the idea that different visual areas constitute highly specialized representations of visual information. {MT} has also proven to be a fertile culture dish--full of direction- and disparity-selective neurons--exploited by many labs to study the neural circuits underlying computations of motion and depth and to examine the relationship between neural activity and perception. Here we attempt a synthetic overview of the rich literature on {MT} with the goal of answering the question, What does {MT} do?},

@article{Goldwyn11,
	Abstract = {Conductance-based equations for electrically active cells form one of the most widely studied mathematical frameworks in computational biology. This framework, as expressed through a set of differential equations by Hodgkin and Huxley, synthesizes the impact of ionic currents on a cell's voltage---and the highly nonlinear impact of that voltage back on the currents themselves---into the rapid push and pull of the action potential. Later studies confirmed that these cellular dynamics are orchestrated by individual ion channels, whose conformational changes regulate the conductance of each ionic current. Thus, kinetic equations familiar from physical chemistry are the natural setting for describing conductances; for small-to-moderate numbers of channels, these will predict fluctuations in conductances and stochasticity in the resulting action potentials. At first glance, the kinetic equations provide a far more complex (and higher-dimensional) description than the original {Hodgkin-Huxley} equations or their counterparts. This has prompted more than a decade of efforts to capture channel fluctuations with noise terms added to the equations of {Hodgkin-Huxley} type. Many of these approaches, while intuitively appealing, produce quantitative errors when compared to kinetic equations; others, as only very recently demonstrated, are both accurate and relatively simple. We review what works, what doesn't, and why, seeking to build a bridge to well-established results for the deterministic equations of {Hodgkin-Huxley} type as well as to more modern models of ion channel dynamics. As such, we hope that this review will speed emerging studies of how channel noise modulates electrophysiological dynamics and function. We supply user-friendly {MATLAB} simulation code of these stochastic versions of the {Hodgkin-Huxley} equations on the {ModelDB} website (accession number 138950) and http://www.amath.washington.edu/\~{}etsb/tu​torials.html.},

@article{Kilpatrick11,
	Abstract = {Gamma rhythms (30-100 Hz) are an extensively studied synchronous brain state responsible for a number of sensory, memory, and motor processes. Experimental evidence suggests that fast-spiking interneurons are responsible for carrying the high frequency components of the rhythm, while regular-spiking pyramidal neurons fire sparsely. We propose that a combination of spike frequency adaptation and global inhibition may be responsible for this behavior. Excitatory neurons form several clusters that fire every few cycles of the fast oscillation. This is first shown in a detailed biophysical network model and then analyzed thoroughly in an idealized model. We exploit the fact that the timescale of adaptation is much slower than that of the other variables. Singular perturbation theory is used to derive an approximate periodic solution for a single spiking unit. This is then used to predict the relationship between the number of clusters arising spontaneously in the network as it relates to the adaptation time constant. We compare this to a complementary analysis that employs a weak coupling assumption to predict the first Fourier mode to destabilize from the incoherent state of an associated phase model as the external noise is reduced. Both approaches predict the same scaling of cluster number with respect to the adaptation time constant, which is corroborated in numerical simulations of the full system. Thus, we develop several testable predictions regarding the formation and characteristics of gamma rhythms with sparsely firing excitatory neurons.},

@article{Daunizeau11,
	Abstract = {This article presents the first attempt to formalize the optimization of experimental design with the aim of comparing models of brain function based on neuroimaging data. We demonstrate our approach in the context of Dynamic Causal Modelling ({DCM}), which relates experimental manipulations to observed network dynamics (via hidden neuronal states) and provides an inference framework for selecting among candidate models. Here, we show how to optimize the sensitivity of model selection by choosing among experimental designs according to their respective model selection accuracy. Using Bayesian decision theory, we (i) derive the {Laplace-Chernoff} risk for model selection, (ii) disclose its relationship with classical design optimality criteria and (iii) assess its sensitivity to basic modelling assumptions. We then evaluate the approach when identifying brain networks using {DCM}. {Monte-Carlo} simulations and empirical analyses of {fMRI} data from a simple bimanual motor task in humans serve to demonstrate the relationship between network identification and the optimal experimental design. For example, we show that deciding whether there is a feedback connection requires shorter epoch durations, relative to asking whether there is experimentally induced change in a connection that is known to be present. Finally, we discuss limitations and potential extensions of this work. During the past two decades, brain mapping research has undergone a paradigm switch. In addition to localizing brain regions that encode specific sensory, motor or cognitive processes, neuroimaging data is nowadays further exploited to ask questions about how information is transmitted through brain networks. The ambition here is to ask questions such as: '' what is the nature of the information that region A passes on to region B''. This can be experimentally addressed by, e.g., showing that the influence that A exerts onto B depends upon specific sensory, motor or cognitive manipulations. This means one has to compare (in a statistical sense) candidate network models of the brain (with different modulations of effective connectivity, say), based on experimental data. The question we address here is how one should design the experiment in order to best discriminate such candidate models. We approach the problem from a statistical decision theoretical perspective, whereby the optimal design is the one that minimizes the model selection error rate. We demonstrate the approach using simulated and empirical data and show how it can be applied to any experimental question that can be framed as a model comparison problem.},

@article{Gandhi11,
	Abstract = {Rapid eyelid closure, or a blink, often accompanies head-restrained and head-unrestrained gaze shifts. This study examines the interactions between such gaze-evoked blinks and gaze shifts in monkeys. Blink probability increases with gaze amplitude and at a faster rate for head-unrestrained movements. Across animals, blink likelihood is inversely correlated with the average gaze velocity of large-amplitude control movements. Gaze-evoked blinks induce robust perturbations in eye velocity. Peak and average velocities are reduced, duration is increased, but accuracy is preserved. The temporal features of the perturbation depend on factors such as the time of blink relative to gaze onset, inherent velocity kinematics of control movements, and perhaps initial eye-in-head position. Although variable across animals, the initial effect is a reduction in eye velocity, followed by a reacceleration that yields two or more peaks in its waveform. Interestingly, head velocity is not attenuated; instead, it peaks slightly later and with a larger magnitude. Gaze latency is slightly reduced on trials with gaze-evoked blinks, although the effect was more variable during head-unrestrained movements; no reduction in head latency is observed. Preliminary data also demonstrate a similar perturbation of gaze-evoked blinks during vertical saccades. The results are compared with previously reported effects of reflexive blinks (evoked by air-puff delivered to one eye or supraorbital nerve stimulation) and discussed in terms of effects of blinks on saccadic suppression, neural correlates of the altered eye velocity signals, and implications on the hypothesis that the attenuation in eye velocity is produced by a head movement command.},

@article{Kay08,
	Abstract = {A challenging goal in neuroscience is to be able to read out, or decode, mental content from brain activity. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies have decoded orientation, position and object category from activity in visual cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli and {fMRI} activity in early visual areas. These models describe the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field models make it possible to identify, from a large set of completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by an observer. Identification is not a mere consequence of the retinotopic organization of visual areas; simpler receptive-field models that describe only spatial tuning yield much poorer identification performance. Our results suggest that it may soon be possible to reconstruct a picture of a person's visual experience from measurements of brain activity alone.},

	Abstract = {Perceptual experience consists of an enormous number of possible states. Previous {fMRI} studies have predicted a perceptual state by classifying brain activity into prespecified categories. Constraint-free visual image reconstruction is more challenging, as it is impractical to specify brain activity for all possible images. In this study, we reconstructed visual images by combining local image bases of multiple scales, whose contrasts were independently decoded from {fMRI} activity by automatically selecting relevant voxels and exploiting their correlated patterns. Binary-contrast, 10 x 10-patch images (2(100) possible states) were accurately reconstructed without any image prior on a single trial or volume basis by measuring brain activity only for several hundred random images. Reconstruction was also used to identify the presented image among millions of candidates. The results suggest that our approach provides an effective means to read out complex perceptual states from brain activity while discovering information representation in multivoxel patterns.},

@article{Hansen07,
	Abstract = {The existence and location of a human counterpart of macaque visual area V4 are disputed. To resolve this issue, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to obtain topographic maps from human subjects, using visual stimuli and tasks designed to maximize accuracy of topographic maps of the fovea and parafovea and to measure the effects of attention on topographic maps. We identified multiple topographic transitions, each clearly visible in > or = 75\% of the maps, that we interpret as boundaries of distinct cortical regions. We call two of these regions dorsal V4 and ventral V4 (together comprising human area V4) because they share several defining characteristics with the macaque regions V4d and V4v (which together comprise macaque area V4). Ventral V4 is adjacent to V3v, and dorsal V4 is adjacent to parafoveal V3d. Ventral V4 and dorsal V4 meet in the foveal confluence shared by V1, V2, and V3. Ventral V4 and dorsal V4 represent complementary regions of the visual field, because ventral V4 represents the upper field and a subregion of the lower field, whereas dorsal V4 represents lower-field locations that are not represented by ventral V4. Finally, attentional modulation of spatial tuning is similar across dorsal and ventral V4, but attention has a smaller effect in V3d and V3v and a larger effect in a neighboring lateral occipital region.},

External space-time events are represented within the {CNS} in overcomplete, inherently oblique, reference frames where space and time information is detected as a continuum over each coordinate axis. (b) The central nervous system may be seen as imposing a geometry on this internal hyperspace in such manner that neuronal networks transform inputs in a metric tensor-like manner.

@article{Field93,
	Abstract = {The Gestalt law of "good continuation" has been used to describe a variety of phenomena demonstrating the importance of continuity in human perception. In this study, we consider how continuity may be represented by a visual system that filters spatial data using arrays of cells selective for orientation and spatial frequency. Many structures (e.g. fractal contours) show a form of redundancy which is well represented by the continuity of features as they vary across space and frequency. We suggest that it is possible to take advantage of the redundancy in continuous, but non-aligned features by associating the outputs of filters with similar tuning. Five experiments were performed, to determine the rules that govern the perception of continuity. Observers were presented with arrays of oriented, band-pass elements (Gabor patches) in which a subset of the elements was aligned along a "jagged" path. Using a forced-choice procedure, observers were found to be capable of identifying the path within a field of randomly-oriented elements even when the spacing between the elements was considerably larger than the size of any of the individual elements. Furthermore, when the elements were oriented at angles up to +/- 60 deg relative to one another, the path was reliably identified. Alignment of the elements along the path was found to play a large role in the ability to detect the path. Small variations in the alignment or aligning the elements orthogonally (i.e. "side-to-side" as opposed to "end-to-end") significantly reduced the observer's ability to detect the presence of a path. The results are discussed in terms of an "association field" which integrates information across neighboring filters tuned to similar orientations. We suggest that some of the processes involved in texture segregation may have a similar explanation.},

@article{Choe04,
	Abstract = {Contour integration in low-level vision is believed to occur based on lateral interaction between neurons with similar orientation tuning. How such interactions could arise in the brain has been an open question. Our model suggests that the interactions can be <i>learned</i> through input-driven self-organization, i.e. through the same mechanism that underlies many other developmental and functional phenomena in the visual cortex. The model also shows how synchronized firing mediated by these lateral connections can represent the percept of a contour, resulting in performance similar to that of human contour integration. The model further demonstrates that contour integration performance can differ in different parts of the visual field, depending on what kinds of input distributions they receive during development. The model thus grounds an important perceptual phenomenon onto detailed neural mechanisms, so that various structural and functional properties can be measured, and predictions can be made to guide future experiments.},

A more plausible mechanism for controlling the Hebbian process has recently emerged. Turrigiano and Nelson [Turrigiano {G.G}., Nelson {S.B}., (2004). Homeostatic plasticity in the developing nervous system. Nature Reviews Neuroscience, 5, 97-107] have shown that neurons in the cortex actively maintain an average firing rate by scaling their incoming weights. In this work, it is shown that this type of homeostatic synaptic scaling can replace the common, but unsupported, standard weight normalization. Organized maps still form and the output neurons are able to maintain an unsaturated firing rate, even in the face of large-scale cell proliferation or die-off. In addition, it is shown that in some cases synaptic scaling leads to networks that more accurately reflect the probability distribution of the input data.},

@article{Callaway90,
	Abstract = {Pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 of adult cat striate cortex have long, intrinsic horizontal axon collaterals within both layer 2/3 and layer 5. These collaterals form periodic "clusters" of finer axon branches that link columns of similar orientation selectivity. We have investigated the sequence of events and possible mechanisms underlying the development of these clustered intrinsic horizontal connections using a combination of neuronal tracers and intracellular staining. Small injections of fluorescent latex microspheres made during the first postnatal week (at P4-6), when examined in tangential sections, produced an even, unclustered distribution of retrogradely labeled cells up to 2 mm from the injection site. At P8, retrograde labeling extended over a larger area and clustering was discernible, primarily among the most distant labeled cells. At both P6 and P8, labeling was similar in layers 2/3 and 5, indicating that the transition from clustered to unclustered connections occurred simultaneously for cells in superficial and deep laminae. By the end of the second postnatal week (P12-15), retrogradely labeled cells were far more clustered both within and beyond the extent of P6 label; the density of labeled cells was high throughout the labeled region, but much higher within clusters. The periodicity of these nascent clusters was similar to that in the adult. Despite obvious clustering, the pattern of retrograde label observed following injections at 2-3 weeks (P12-21) differed markedly from the adult, in that the regions between clusters contained many labeled cells. Over the next 3 weeks, the connections were refined, so that by the sixth postnatal week (P36-38), regions between clusters contained very few retrogradely labeled cells and the overall pattern of retrograde label was indistinguishable from that in adults. Despite differences in postmigratory ages of neurons from the superficial and deep laminae, clustering of retrogradely labeled cells from these 2 populations was similar at all ages. Experiments in which 2-3 weeks elapsed between the time microsphere injections were made and animals were killed demonstrated that neither the initial formation of crude clusters nor their refinement was due to cell death. Instead, cluster refinement resulted from specific process elimination. When a red microsphere injection at P15 was followed by a green microsphere injection at exactly the same location on P29, the earlier injection resulted in crude clustering, as expected. Virtually all of the cells double-labeled by the later injection were within the densest clusters of label from the early {injection.(ABSTRACT} {TRUNCATED} {AT} 400 {WORDS})},

@article{Saeb11,
	Abstract = {Various optimality principles have been proposed to explain the characteristics of coordinated eye and head movements during visual orienting behavior. At the same time, researchers have suggested several neural models to underly the generation of saccades, but these do not include online learning as a mechanism of optimization. Here, we suggest an open-loop neural controller with a local adaptation mechanism that minimizes a proposed cost function. Simulations show that the characteristics of coordinated eye and head movements generated by this model match the experimental data in many aspects, including the relationship between amplitude, duration and peak velocity in head-restrained and the relative contribution of eye and head to the total gaze shift in head-free conditions. Our model is a first step towards bringing together an optimality principle and an incremental local learning mechanism into a unified control scheme for coordinated eye and head movements. Human beings and many other species redirect their gaze towards targets of interest through rapid gaze shifts known as saccades. These are made approximately three to four times every second, and larger saccades result from fast and concurrent movement of the animal's eyes and head. Experimental studies have revealed that during saccades, the motor system follows certain principles such as respecting a specific relationship between the relative contribution of eye and head motor systems to total gaze shift. Various researchers have hypothesized that these principles are implications of some optimality criteria in the brain, but it remains unclear how the brain can learn such an optimal behavior. We propose a new model that uses a plausible learning mechanism to satisfy an optimality criterion. We show that after learning, the model is able to reproduce motor behavior with biologically plausible properties. In addition, it predicts the nature of the learning signals. Further experimental research is necessary to test the validity of our model.},

@article{Terao10,
	Abstract = {Human observers see a single mixed color (yellow) when different colors (red and green) rapidly alternate. Accumulating evidence suggests that the critical temporal frequency beyond which chromatic fusion occurs does not simply reflect the temporal limit of peripheral encoding. However, it remains poorly understood how the central processing controls the fusion frequency. Here we show that the fusion frequency can be elevated by extra-retinal signals during smooth pursuit. This eye movement can keep the image of a moving target in the fovea, but it also introduces a backward retinal sweep of the stationary background pattern. We found that the fusion frequency was higher when retinal color changes were generated by pursuit-induced background motions than when the same retinal color changes were generated by object motions during eye fixation. This temporal improvement cannot be ascribed to a general increase in contrast gain of specific neural mechanisms during pursuit, since the improvement was not observed with a pattern flickering without changing position on the retina or with a pattern moving in the direction opposite to the background motion during pursuit. Our findings indicate that chromatic fusion is controlled by a cortical mechanism that suppresses motion blur. A plausible mechanism is that eye-movement signals change spatiotemporal trajectories along which color signals are integrated so as to reduce chromatic integration at the same locations (i.e., along stationary trajectories) on the retina that normally causes retinal blur during fixation.},

@article{Souman08,
	Abstract = {Smooth pursuit eye movements add motion to the retinal image. To compensate, the visual system can combine estimates of pursuit velocity and retinal motion to recover motion with respect to the head. Little attention has been paid to the temporal characteristics of this compensation process. Here, we describe how the latency difference between the eye movement signal and the retinal signal can be measured for motion perception during sinusoidal pursuit. In two experiments, observers compared the peak velocity of a motion stimulus presented in pursuit and fixation intervals. Both the pursuit target and the motion stimulus moved with a sinusoidal profile. The phase and amplitude of the motion stimulus were varied systematically in different conditions, along with the amplitude of pursuit. The latency difference between the eye movement signal and the retinal signal was measured by fitting the standard linear model and a non-linear variant to the observed velocity matches. We found that the eye movement signal lagged the retinal signal by a small amount. The non-linear model fitted the velocity matches better than the linear one and this difference increased with pursuit amplitude. The results support previous claims that the visual system estimates eye movement velocity and retinal velocity in a non-linear fashion and that the latency difference between the two signals is small.},

When this method is used, feedforward and feedback connections are learned simultaneously and independently in a biologically plausible manner. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated by applying it to learning the elementary components of artificial and natural images. For artificial images, the bars problem is employed, and the proposed algorithm is shown to produce state-of-the-art performance on this task. For natural images, components resembling Gabor functions are learned in the first processing stage, and neurons responsive to corners are learned in the second processing stage. The properties of these learned representations are in good agreement with neurophysiological data from V1 and V2. The proposed algorithm demonstrates for the first time that a single computational theory can explain the formation of cortical {RFs} and also the response properties of cortical neurons once those {RFs} have been learned.},

	Abstract = {Area {MT} has been an important target for studies of motion processing. However, previous neurophysiological studies of {MT} have used simple stimuli that do not contain many of the motion signals that occur during natural vision. In this study we sought to determine whether views of area {MT} neurons developed using simple stimuli can account for {MT} responses under more naturalistic conditions. We recorded responses from macaque area {MT} neurons during stimulation with naturalistic movies. We then used a quantitative modeling framework to discover which specific mechanisms best predict neuronal responses under these challenging conditions. We find that the simplest model that accurately predicts responses of {MT} neurons consists of a bank of V1-like filters, each followed by a compressive nonlinearity, a divisive nonlinearity, and linear pooling. Inspection of the fit models shows that the excitatory receptive fields of {MT} neurons tend to lie on a single plane within the three-dimensional spatiotemporal frequency domain, and suppressive receptive fields lie off this plane. However, most excitatory receptive fields form a partial ring in the plane and avoid low temporal frequencies. This receptive field organization ensures that most {MT} neurons are tuned for velocity but do not tend to respond to ambiguous static textures that are aligned with the direction of motion. In sum, {MT} responses to naturalistic movies are largely consistent with predictions based on simple stimuli. However, models fit using naturalistic stimuli reveal several novel properties of {MT} receptive fields that had not been shown in prior experiments.},

@article{Park11,
	Abstract = {The linear receptive field describes a mapping from sensory stimuli to a one-dimensional variable governing a neuron's spike response. However, traditional receptive field estimators such as the spike-triggered average converge slowly and often require large amounts of data. Bayesian methods seek to overcome this problem by biasing estimates towards solutions that are more likely a priori, typically those with small, smooth, or sparse coefficients. Here we introduce a novel Bayesian receptive field estimator designed to incorporate locality, a powerful form of prior information about receptive field structure. The key to our approach is a hierarchical receptive field model that flexibly adapts to localized structure in both spacetime and spatiotemporal frequency, using an inference method known as empirical Bayes. We refer to our method as automatic locality determination ({ALD}), and show that it can accurately recover various types of smooth, sparse, and localized receptive fields. We apply {ALD} to neural data from retinal ganglion cells and V1 simple cells, and find it achieves error rates several times lower than standard estimators. Thus, estimates of comparable accuracy can be achieved with substantially less data. Finally, we introduce a computationally efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo ({MCMC}) algorithm for fully Bayesian inference under the {ALD} prior, yielding accurate Bayesian confidence intervals for small or noisy datasets. A central problem in systems neuroscience is to understand how sensory neurons convert environmental stimuli into spike trains. The receptive field ({RF}) provides a simple model for the first stage in this encoding process: it is a linear filter that describes how the neuron integrates the stimulus over time and space. A neuron's {RF} can be estimated using responses to white noise or naturalistic stimuli, but traditional estimators such as the spike-triggered average tend to be noisy and require large amounts of data to converge. Here, we introduce a novel estimator that can accurately determine {RFs} with far less data. The key insight is that {RFs} tend to be localized in spacetime and spatiotemporal frequency. We introduce a family of prior distributions that flexibly incorporate these tendencies, using an approach known as empirical Bayes. These methods will allow experimentalists to characterize {RFs} more accurately and more rapidly, freeing more time for other experiments. We argue that locality, which is a structured form of sparsity, may play an important role in a wide variety of biological inference problems.},

@article{Gilson11,
	Abstract = {Spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) has been shown to enable single neurons to detect repeatedly presented spatiotemporal spike patterns. This holds even when such patterns are embedded in equally dense random spiking activity, that is, in the absence of external reference times such as a stimulus onset. Here we demonstrate, both analytically and numerically, that {STDP} can also learn repeating rate-modulated patterns, which have received more experimental evidence, for example, through post-stimulus time histograms ({PSTHs}). Each input spike train is generated from a rate function using a stochastic sampling mechanism, chosen to be an inhomogeneous Poisson process here. Learning is feasible provided significant covarying rate modulations occur within the typical timescale of {STDP} (\~{}10--20 ms) for sufficiently many inputs (\~{}100 among 1000 in our simulations), a condition that is met by many experimental {PSTHs}. Repeated pattern presentations induce spike-time correlations that are captured by {STDP}. Despite imprecise input spike times and even variable spike counts, a single trained neuron robustly detects the pattern just a few milliseconds after its presentation. Therefore, temporal imprecision and Poisson-like firing variability are not an obstacle to fast temporal coding. {STDP} provides an appealing mechanism to learn such rate patterns, which, beyond sensory processing, may also be involved in many cognitive tasks. In vivo neural responses to stimuli are known to have a lot of variability across trials. If the same number of spikes is emitted from trial to trial, the neuron is said to be reliable. If the timing of such spikes is roughly preserved across trials, the neuron is said to be precise. Here we demonstrate both analytically and numerically that the well-established Hebbian learning rule of spike-timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}) can learn response patterns despite relatively low reliability (Poisson-like variability) and low temporal precision (10--20 ms). These features are in line with many experimental observations, in which a poststimulus time histogram ({PSTH}) is evaluated over multiple trials. In our model, however, information is extracted from the relative spike times between afferents without the need of an absolute reference time, such as a stimulus onset. Relevantly, recent experiments show that relative timing is often more informative than the absolute timing. Furthermore, the scope of application for our study is not restricted to sensory systems. Taken together, our results suggest a fine temporal resolution for the neural code, and that {STDP} is an appropriate candidate for encoding and decoding such activity.},

	Abstract = {Sparse coding algorithms trained on natural images can accurately predict the features that excite visual cortical neurons, but it is not known whether such codes can be learned using biologically realistic plasticity rules. We have developed a biophysically motivated spiking network, relying solely on synaptically local information, that can predict the full diversity of V1 simple cell receptive field shapes when trained on natural images. This represents the first demonstration that sparse coding principles, operating within the constraints imposed by cortical architecture, can successfully reproduce these receptive fields. We further prove, mathematically, that sparseness and decorrelation are the key ingredients that allow for synaptically local plasticity rules to optimize a cooperative, linear generative image model formed by the neural representation. Finally, we discuss several interesting emergent properties of our network, with the intent of bridging the gap between theoretical and experimental studies of visual cortex. In a sparse coding model, individual input stimuli are represented by the activities of model neurons, the majority of which are inactive in response to any particular stimulus. For a given class of stimuli, the neurons are optimized so that the stimuli can be faithfully represented with the minimum number of co-active units. This has been proposed as a model for visual cortex. While it has previously been demonstrated that sparse coding model neurons, when trained on natural images, learn to represent the same features as do neurons in primate visual cortex, it remains to be demonstrated that this can be achieved with physiologically realistic plasticity rules. In particular, learning in cortex appears to occur by the modification of synaptic connections between neurons, which must depend only on information available locally, at the synapse, and not, for example, on the properties of large numbers of distant cells. We provide the first demonstration that synaptically local plasticity rules are sufficient to learn a sparse image code, and to account for the observed response properties of visual cortical neurons: visual cortex actually could learn a sparse image code.},

	Abstract = {Visual aftereffects have been found for a wide variety of stimuli, ranging from oriented lines to human faces, but previous results suggested that face aftereffects were qualitatively different from orientation (tilt) aftereffects. Using computational models, we predicted that these differences were due to the limited range of faces used in previous studies. Here we report psychophysical results verifying this prediction. We used the same paradigm to test tilt aftereffects ({TAE}) and face gender aftereffects ({FAE}) and found that they exhibited qualitatively similar aftereffect curves, when a sufficiently large range of test faces was used. Overall, the results suggest that similar adaptation mechanisms may underlie both high-level and low-level visual processing.},

@article{Burn08,
	Abstract = {This review of rat sensory perception spans eight decades of work conducted across diverse research fields. It covers rat vision, audition, olfaction, gustation, and somatosensation, and describes how rat perception differs from and coincides with ours. As Nagel's seminal work (1974) implies, we cannot truly know what it is like to be a rat, but we can identify and acknowledge their perceptual biases. These primarily nocturnal rodents are extremely sensitive to light, with artificial lighting frequently causing retinal degeneration, and their vision extends into the ultraviolet. Their olfactory sensitivity and ultrasonic hearing means they are influenced by environmental factors and conspecific signals that we cannot perceive. Rat and human gustation are similar, being opportunistic omnivores, yet this sense becomes largely redundant in the laboratory, where rodents typically consume a single homogenous diet. Rat somatosensation differs from ours in their thigmotactic tendencies and highly sensitive, specialised vibrissae. Knowledge of species-specific perceptual abilities can enhance experimental designs, target resources, and improve animal welfare. Furthermore, the sensory environment has influences from neurone to behaviour, so it can not only affect the senses directly, but also behaviour, health, physiology, and neurophysiology. Research shows that environmental enrichment is necessary for normal visual, auditory, and somatosensory development. Laboratory rats are not quite the simple, convenient models they are sometimes taken for; although very adaptable, they are complex mammals existing in an environment they are not evolutionarily adapted for. Here, many important implications of rat perception are highlighted, and suggestions are made for refining experiments and housing.},

@article{Namikawa11,
	Abstract = {The current article suggests that deterministic chaos self-organized in cortical dynamics could be responsible for the generation of spontaneous action sequences. Recently, various psychological observations have suggested that humans and primates can learn to extract statistical structures hidden in perceptual sequences experienced during active environmental interactions. Although it has been suggested that such statistical structures involve chunking or compositional primitives, their neuronal implementations in brains have not yet been clarified. Therefore, to reconstruct the phenomena, synthetic neuro-robotics experiments were conducted by using a neural network model, which is characterized by a generative model with intentional states and its multiple timescales dynamics. The experimental results showed that the robot successfully learned to imitate tutored behavioral sequence patterns by extracting the underlying transition probability among primitive actions. An analysis revealed that a set of primitive action patterns was embedded in the fast dynamics part, and the chaotic dynamics of spontaneously sequencing these action primitive patterns was structured in the slow dynamics part, provided that the timescale was adequately set for each part. It was also shown that self-organization of this type of functional hierarchy ensured robust action generation by the robot in its interactions with a noisy environment. This article discusses the correspondence of the synthetic experiments with the known hierarchy of the prefrontal cortex, the supplementary motor area, and the primary motor cortex for action generation. We speculate that deterministic dynamical structures organized in the prefrontal cortex could be essential because they can account for the generation of both intentional behaviors of fixed action sequences and spontaneous behaviors of pseudo-stochastic action sequences by the same mechanism. Various psychological observations have suggested that the spontaneously generated behaviors of humans reflect statistical structures extracted via perceptual learning of everyday practices and experiences while interacting with the world. Although those studies have further suggested that such acquired statistical structures use chunking, which generates a variety of complex actions recognized in compositional manner, the underlying neural mechanism has not been clarified. The current neuro-robotics study presents a model prediction for the mechanism and an evaluation of the model through physically grounded experiments on action imitation learning. The model features learning of a mapping from intentional states to action sequences based on multiple timescales dynamics characteristics. The experimental results suggest that deterministic chaos self-organized in the slower timescale part of the network dynamics is responsible for generating spontaneous transitions among primitive actions by reflecting the extracted statistical structures. The robustness of action generation in a noisy physical environment is preserved. These results agree with other neuroscience evidence of the hierarchical organization in the cortex for voluntary actions. Finally, as presented in a discussion of the results, the deterministic cortical dynamics are presumed crucial in generating not only more intentional fixed action sequences but also less intentional spontaneously transitive action sequences.},

	Abstract = {The response of a neuronal population to afferent drive can be expected to be sensitive to both the distribution and dynamics of membrane voltages within the population. Voltage fluctuations can be driven by synaptic noise, neuromodulators, or cellular inhomogeneities: processes ranging from millisecond autocorrelation times to effectively static or '' frozen'' noise. Here we extend previous studies of filtered fluctuations to the experimentally verified exponential integrate-and-fire model. How fast or frozen fluctuations affect the steady-state rate and firing-rate response are both examined using perturbative solutions and limits of a 1 + 2 dimensional {Fokker-Planck} equation. The central finding is that, under conditions of a more-or-less constant population voltage variance, the firing-rate response is only weakly dependent on the fluctuation filter constant: The voltage distribution is the principal determinant of the population response. This result is unexpected given the nature of the systems underlying the extreme limits of fast and frozen fluctuations; the first limit represents a homogeneous population of neurons firing stochastically, whereas the second limit is equivalent to a heterogeneous population of neurons firing deterministically.},

@article{Tchumatchenko11,
	Abstract = {Many sensory or cognitive events are associated with dynamic current modulations in cortical neurons. This raises an urgent demand for tractable model approaches addressing the merits and limits of potential encoding strategies. Yet, current theoretical approaches addressing the response to mean- and variance-encoded stimuli rarely provide complete response functions for both modes of encoding in the presence of correlated noise. Here, we investigate the neuronal population response to dynamical modifications of the mean or variance of the synaptic bombardment using an alternative threshold model framework. In the variance and mean channel, we provide explicit expressions for the linear and non-linear frequency response functions in the presence of correlated noise and use them to derive population rate response to step-like stimuli. For mean-encoded signals, we find that the complete response function depends only on the temporal width of the input correlation function, but not on other functional specifics. Furthermore, we show that both mean- and variance-encoded signals can relay high-frequency inputs, and in both schemes step-like changes can be detected instantaneously. Finally, we obtain the pairwise spike correlation function and the spike triggered average from the linear mean-evoked response function. These results provide a maximally tractable limiting case that complements and extends previous results obtained in the integrate and fire framework. Sensory stimuli in our environment are represented in the brain as input current changes to neurons. For example, a periodic bar pattern in the visual field leads to periodic current modulations in the visual cortex. Therefore, models describing the ability of neurons to represent incoming stimuli can offer important clues about how sensory stimuli are processed by the brain. As anyone who has used an old-fashioned radio can attest, there is not just one but multiple ways to encode a signal, e.g. the familiar {AM} and {FM} channels. But what are the potential encoding channels in the cortex? A signal could modify the neuronal input current in two distinct ways: it could act either on the mean or the variance of the current. Using a minimal model framework, which can reproduce many features of neuronal activity, we find that both encoding schemes could be equally potent in transmitting slow and fast signals. This allows us to describe how input signals of any functional form give rise to collective firing rate changes in populations of neurons.},

Emphasis is on three oculomotor behaviors: gaze control, smooth pursuit and saccades, and on their interactions with vision. Focus over the past 25 years has remained on the fundamental and classical questions: What are the mechanisms that keep gaze stable with either stationary or moving targets? How does the motion of the image on the retina affect vision? Where do we look -- and why -- when performing a complex task? How can the world appear clear and stable despite continual movements of the eyes? The past 25 years of investigation of these questions has seen progress and transformations at all levels due to new approaches (behavioral, neural and theoretical) aimed at studying how eye movements cope with real-world visual and cognitive demands. The work has led to a better understanding of how prediction, learning and attention work with sensory signals to contribute to the effective operation of eye movements in visually rich environments.},

	Abstract = {Entorhinal grid cells in mammals fire as a function of animal location, with spatially periodic response patterns. This nonlocal periodic representation of location, a local variable, is unlike other neural codes. There is no theoretical explanation for why such a code should exist. We examined how accurately the grid code with noisy neurons allows an ideal observer to estimate location and found this code to be a previously unknown type of population code with unprecedented robustness to noise. In particular, the representational accuracy attained by grid cells over the coding range was in a qualitatively different class from what is possible with observed sensory and motor population codes. We found that a simple neural network can effectively correct the grid code. To the best of our knowledge, these results are the first demonstration that the brain contains, and may exploit, powerful error-correcting codes for analog variables. {\\\\copyright} 2011 Nature America, Inc.

The basic idea of this technique consists in extracting image statistics locally from the heterogeneous region (foreground or background) and globally from the other region at each point along the curve. By exploiting benefits of both local-based and global-based statistics, this technique proves to be robust against heterogeneity and noise and shows low sensitivity to curve initialization. Experimental results for synthetic and real images reveal significant improvement compared to conventional methods.},

@article{Chossat11,
	Abstract = {Motivated by a model for the perception of textures by the visual cortex in primates, we analyze the bifurcation of periodic patterns for nonlinear equations describing the state of a system defined on the space of structure tensors, when these equations are further invariant with respect to the isometries of this space. We show that the problem reduces to a bifurcation problem in the hyperbolic plane (Poincar\'{e} disc). We make use of the concept of a periodic lattice in to further reduce the problem to one on a compact Riemann surface , where Γ is a cocompact, torsion-free Fuchsian group. The knowledge of the symmetry group of this surface allows us to use the machinery of equivariant bifurcation theory. Solutions which generically bifurcate are called '' H-planforms'', by analogy with the '' planforms'' introduced for pattern formation in Euclidean space. This concept is applied to the case of an octagonal periodic pattern, where we are able to classify all possible H-planforms satisfying the hypotheses of the Equivariant Branching Lemma. These patterns are, however, not straightforward to compute, even numerically, and in the last section we describe a method for computation illustrated with a selection of images of octagonal H-planforms.},

@article{Fournier11,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields in primary visual cortex (V1) are categorized as simple or complex, depending on their spatial selectivity to stimulus contrast polarity. We studied the dependence of this classification on visual context by comparing, in the same cell, the synaptic responses to three classical receptive field mapping protocols: sparse noise, ternary dense noise and flashed Gabor noise. Intracellular recordings revealed that the relative weights of simple-like and complex-like receptive field components were scaled so as to make the same receptive field more simple-like with dense noise stimulation and more complex-like with sparse or Gabor noise stimulations. However, once these context-dependent receptive fields were convolved with the corresponding stimulus, the balance between simple-like and complex-like contributions to the synaptic responses appeared to be invariant across input statistics. This normalization of the linear/nonlinear input ratio suggests a previously unknown form of homeostatic control of V1 functional properties, optimizing the network nonlinearities to the statistical structure of the visual input.},

@article{Jacques08,
	Abstract = {This paper studies the effect of discretizing the parametrization of a dictionary used for matching pursuit ({MP}) decompositions of signals. Our approach relies on viewing the continuously parametrized dictionary as an embedded manifold in the signal space on which the tools of differential (Riemannian) geometry can be applied. The main contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we prove that if a discrete dictionary reaches a minimal density criterion, then the corresponding discrete {MP} ({dMP}) is equivalent in terms of convergence to a weakened hypothetical continuous {MP}. Interestingly, the corresponding weakness factor depends on a density measure of the discrete dictionary. Second, we show that the insertion of a simple geometric gradient ascent optimization on the atom {dMP} selection maintains the previous comparison but with a weakness factor at least two times closer to unity than without optimization. Finally, we present numerical experiments confirming our theoretical predictions for decomposition of signals and images on regular discretizations of dictionary parametrizations.},

@article{Weir11,
	Abstract = {How do biological agents plan and organise a smooth accurate path to shift from one smooth mode of behaviour to another as part of graceful movement that is both plastic and controlled? This paper addresses the question in conducting a novel shape analysis of approach and adjustment phases in rapid voluntary target aiming and {2-D} reaching hand actions. A number of mode changing experiments are reported that investigate these actions under a range of goals and conditions. After a typically roughly aimed approach, regular projective adjustment is observed that has height and velocity kinematic profiles that are scaled copies of one another. This empirical property is encapsulated as a novel self-similar shift function . The mathematics shows that the biological shifts consist of continual deviation from their full Taylor series everywhere throughout their interval, which is a deep form of plasticity not described before. The experimental results find the same approach and adjustment strategy to occur with behavioural trajectories over the full and varied range of tested goals and conditions. The trajectory shapes have a large degree of predictability through using the shift function to handle extensive variation in the trajectories' adjustment across individual behaviours and subjects. We provide connections between the behavioural features and results and various neural studies to show how the methodology may be exploited. The conclusion is that a roughly aimed approach followed by a specific highly plastic shift adjustment can provide a regular basis for fast and accurate goal-directed motion in a simple and generalisable way.},

@article{Schmidt11,
	Abstract = {The reverse engineering of metabolic networks from experimental data is traditionally a labor-intensive task requiring a priori systems knowledge. Using a proven model as a test system, we demonstrate an automated method to simplify this process by modifying an existing or related model---suggesting nonlinear terms and structural modifications---or even constructing a new model that agrees with the system's time series observations. In certain cases, this method can identify the full dynamical model from scratch without prior knowledge or structural assumptions. The algorithm selects between multiple candidate models by designing experiments to make their predictions disagree. We performed computational experiments to analyze a nonlinear seven-dimensional model of yeast glycolytic oscillations. This approach corrected mistakes reliably in both approximated and overspecified models. The method performed well to high levels of noise for most states, could identify the correct model de novo , and make better predictions than ordinary parametric regression and neural network models. We identified an invariant quantity in the model, which accurately derived kinetics and the numerical sensitivity coefficients of the system. Finally, we compared the system to dynamic flux estimation and discussed the scaling and application of this methodology to automated experiment design and control in biological systems in real time.},

	Abstract = {Recent studies have used {fMRI} signals from early visual areas to reconstruct simple geometric patterns. Here, we demonstrate a new Bayesian decoder that uses {fMRI} signals from early and anterior visual areas to reconstruct complex natural images. Our decoder combines three elements: a structural encoding model that characterizes responses in early visual areas, a semantic encoding model that characterizes responses in anterior visual areas, and prior information about the structure and semantic content of natural images. By combining all these elements, the decoder produces reconstructions that accurately reflect both the spatial structure and semantic category of the objects contained in the observed natural image. Our results show that prior information has a substantial effect on the quality of natural image reconstructions. We also demonstrate that much of the variance in the responses of anterior visual areas to complex natural images is explained by the semantic category of the image alone.},

@article{Moore11,
	Abstract = {Compared to the developing visual system, where neuronal plasticity has been well characterized at multiple levels, little is known about plasticity in the adult, particularly within subcortical structures. We made intraocular injections of 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid ({APB}) in adult cats to block visual responses in On-center retinal ganglion cells and examined the consequences on visual responses in the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) of the thalamus. In contrast to current views of retinogeniculate organization, which hold that On-center {LGN} neurons should become silent with {APB}, we find that ∼50\% of On-center neurons rapidly develop Off-center responses. The time course of these emergent responses and the actions of {APB} in the retina indicate the plasticity occurs within the {LGN}. These results suggest there is greater divergence of retinogeniculate connections than previously recognized and that functionally silent, nonspecific retinal inputs can serve as a substrate for rapid plasticity in the adult.},

@article{Yang11,
	Abstract = {Recent researches have shown that the sparse representation based technology can lead to state of art super-resolution image reconstruction ({SRIR}) result. It relies on the idea that the low-resolution ({LR}) image patches can be regarded as down sampled version of high-resolution ({HR}) images, whose patches are assumed to have a sparser presentation with respect to a dictionary of prototype patches. In order to avoid a large training patches database and obtain more accurate recovery of {HR} images, in this paper we introduce the concept of examples-aided redundant dictionary learning into the single-image super-resolution reconstruction, and propose a multiple dictionaries learning scheme inspired by multitask learning. Compact redundant dictionaries are learned from samples classified by K-means clustering in order to provide each sample a more appropriate dictionary for image reconstruction. Compared with the available {SRIR} methods, the proposed method has the following characteristics: (1) introducing the example patches-aided dictionary learning in the sparse representation based {SRIR}, in order to reduce the intensive computation complexity brought by enormous dictionary, (2) using the multitask learning and prior from {HR} image examples to reconstruct similar {HR} images to obtain better reconstruction result and (3) adopting the offline dictionaries learning and online reconstruction, making a rapid reconstruction possible. Some experiments are taken on testing the proposed method on some natural images, and the results show that a small set of randomly chosen raw patches from training images and small number of atoms can produce good reconstruction result. Both the visual result and the numerical guidelines prove its superiority to some start-of-art {SRIR} methods.},

	Abstract = {Self-organization is a widely used technique in unsupervised learning and data analysis, largely exemplified by k-means clustering, self-organizing maps ({SOM}) and adaptive resonance theory. In this paper we present a new algorithm: {TurSOM}, inspired by Turing's unorganized machines and Kohonen's {SOM}. Turing's unorganized machines are an early model of neural networks characterized by self-organizing connections, as opposed to self-organizing neurons in {SOM}. {TurSOM} introduces three new mechanisms to facilitate both neuron and connection self-organization. These mechanisms are: a connection learning rate, connection reorganization, and a neuron responsibility radius. {TurSOM} is implemented in a 1-dimensional network (i.e. chain of neurons) to exemplify the theoretical implications of these features. In this paper we demonstrate that {TurSOM} is superior to the classical {SOM} algorithm in several ways: (1) speed until convergence; (2) independent clusters; and (3) tangle-free networks.},

	Abstract = {The perceived brightness of a gray patch depends on the surrounding context. For example, a medium-gray patch appears darker when placed on a bright background and brighter when placed on a dark background. Models to explain these effects are usually based on simple low-level mechanisms. A new set of brightness illusions cannot be explained by such models. In these illusions, the brightness percept is strongly influenced by the perceptual organization of the stimuli. Simple modifications of the stimuli that should have little effect on low-level mechanisms greatly alter the strength of the illusion. These effects may be ascribed to more complex mechanisms occurring later in the visual system. 10.1126/science.8266102},

@article{Nishimoto11a,
	Abstract = {Quantitative modeling of human brain activity can provide crucial insights about cortical representations [ [1] and [2] ] and can form the basis for brain decoding devices [ [3] , [4] and [5] ]. Recent functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) studies have modeled brain activity elicited by static visual patterns and have reconstructed these patterns from brain activity [ [6] , [7] and [8] ]. However, blood oxygen level-dependent ({BOLD}) signals measured via {fMRI} are very slow [9], so it has been difficult to model brain activity elicited by dynamic stimuli such as natural movies. Here we present a new motion-energy [ [10] and [11] ] encoding model that largely overcomes this limitation. The model describes fast visual information and slow hemodynamics by separate components. We recorded {BOLD} signals in occipitotemporal visual cortex of human subjects who watched natural movies and fit the model separately to individual voxels. Visualization of the fit models reveals how early visual areas represent the information in movies. To demonstrate the power of our approach, we also constructed a Bayesian decoder [8] by combining estimated encoding models with a sampled natural movie prior. The decoder provides remarkable reconstructions of the viewed movies. These results demonstrate that dynamic brain activity measured under naturalistic conditions can be decoded using current {fMRI} technology.},

@article{Raudies10,
	Abstract = {How does the visual system manage to segment a visual scene into surfaces and objects and manage to attend to a target object? Based on psychological and physiological investigations, it has been proposed that the perceptual organization and segmentation of a scene is achieved by the processing at different levels of the visual cortical hierarchy. According to this, motion onset detection, motion-defined shape segregation, and target selection are accomplished by processes which bind together simple features into fragments of increasingly complex configurations at different levels in the processing hierarchy. As an alternative to this hierarchical processing hypothesis, it has been proposed that the processing stages for feature detection and segregation are reflected in different temporal episodes in the response patterns of individual neurons. Such temporal epochs have been observed in the activation pattern of neurons as low as in area V1. Here, we present a neural network model of motion detection, figure-ground segregation and attentive selection which explains these response patterns in an unifying framework. Based on known principles of functional architecture of the visual cortex, we propose that initial motion and motion boundaries are detected at different and hierarchically organized stages in the dorsal pathway. Visual shapes that are defined by boundaries, which were generated from juxtaposed opponent motions, are represented at different stages in the ventral pathway. Model areas in the different pathways interact through feedforward and modulating feedback, while mutual interactions enable the communication between motion and form representations. Selective attention is devoted to shape representations by sending modulating feedback signals from higher levels (working memory) to intermediate levels to enhance their responses. Areas in the motion and form pathway are coupled through top-down feedback with V1 cells at the bottom end of the hierarchy. We propose that the different temporal episodes in the response pattern of V1 cells, as recorded in recent experiments, reflect the strength of modulating feedback signals. This feedback results from the consolidated shape representations from coherent motion patterns and the attentive modulation of responses along the cortical hierarchy. The model makes testable predictions concerning the duration and delay of the temporal episodes of V1 cell responses as well as their response variations that were caused by modulating feedback signals.},

@article{Raudies11,
	Abstract = {Motion transparency occurs when multiple coherent motions are perceived in one spatial location. Imagine, for instance, looking out of the window of a bus on a bright day, where the world outside the window is passing by and movements of passengers inside the bus are reflected in the window. The overlay of both motions at the window leads to motion transparency, which is challenging to process. Noisy and ambiguous motion signals can be reduced using a competition mechanism for all encoded motions in one spatial location. Such a competition, however, leads to the suppression of multiple peak responses that encode different motions, as only the strongest response tends to survive. As a solution, we suggest a local center-surround competition for population-encoded motion directions and speeds. Similar motions are supported, and dissimilar ones are separated, by representing them as multiple activations, which occurs in the case of motion transparency. Psychophysical findings, such as motion attraction and repulsion for motion transparency displays, can be explained by this local competition. Besides this local competition mechanism, we show that feedback signals improve the processing of motion transparency. A discrimination task for transparent versus opaque motion is simulated, where motion transparency is generated by superimposing large field motion patterns of either varying size or varying coherence of motion. The model?s perceptual thresholds with and without feedback are calculated. We demonstrate that initially weak peak responses can be enhanced and stabilized through modulatory feedback signals from higher stages of processing.},

@article{Rockland96,
	Abstract = {Nonreciprocal feedback connections from ventromedial areas {TE} and {TF} have previously been reported to visual areas V1 and V2 (Kennedy and Bullier, 1985; Rockland and Van Hoesen, 1994). The present report confirms these earlier observations by utilizing anterograde label in conjunction with serial section analysis. Furthermore, it directly demonstrates the divergent configuration and range of these terminal fields. Thirteen axons were analyzed from ventromedial {TE} (4) or area {TF} (9) to occipitotemporal areas, and two from area {TF} to the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus ({IPS}). All these axons have narrow, elongated fields that range from 4.0-21.0 mm. Terminations are distributed linearly along the axon or, in some cases, concentrated in irregularly spaced clusters. Most of these axons have terminations concentrated in layer 1. The two axons in the {IPS} have a bistratified terminal distribution (in layers 1-3 and 6) in their anterior field, but a distinctly different laminar pattern (with terminations concentrated in layer 1) in their distal 2.0 mm. These fields probably correspond to different areas, most likely {MIP} and {PO}. Axons projecting from higher order to early visual areas may contribute to extraperceptual, complex processes within area V1, such as activation in response to visual imagery, and are a possible substrate for synchronous linkage of spatially discrete assemblies of neurons. In summary, these results demonstrate 1) that some neurons in ventromedial {TE} and {TF} are in direct communication with early visual areas, including V1 and V2, and 2) that some feedback axons target several areas, sometimes with different laminar termination patterns. These results emphasize that cortical areas are interrelated by multiple direct and indirect pathways, not all of which are strictly hierarchical.},

	Abstract = {A spiking neural network that learns temporal sequences is described. A sparse code in which individual neurons represent sequences and subsequences enables multiple sequences to be stored without interference. The network is founded on a model of sequence compression in the hippocampus that is robust to variation in sequence element duration and well suited to learn sequences through spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}). Three additions to the sequence compression model underlie the sparse representation: synapses connecting the neurons of the network that are subject to {STDP}, a competitive plasticity rule so that neurons specialize to individual sequences, and neural depolarization after spiking so that neurons have a memory. The response to new sequence elements is determined by the neurons that have responded to the previous subsequence, according to the competitively learned synaptic connections. Numerical simulations show that the model can learn sets of intersecting sequences, presented with widely differing frequencies, with elements of varying duration.},

@article{Shankar11,
	Abstract = {We propose a principled way to construct an internal representation of the temporal stimulus history leading up to the present moment. A set of leaky integrators performs a Laplace transform on the stimulus function, and a linear operator approximates the inversion of the Laplace transform. The result is a representation of stimulus history that retains information about the temporal sequence of stimuli. This procedure naturally represents more recent stimuli more accurately than less recent stimuli; the decrement in accuracy is precisely scale invariant. This procedure also yields time cells that fire at specific latencies following the stimulus with a scale-invariant temporal spread. Combined with a simple associative memory, this representation gives rise to a moment-to-moment prediction that is also scale invariant in time. We propose that this scale-invariant representation of temporal stimulus history could serve as an underlying representation accessible to higher-level behavioral and cognitive mechanisms. In order to illustrate the potential utility of this scale-invariant representation in a variety of fields, we sketch applications using minimal performance functions to problems in classical conditioning, interval timing, scale-invariant learning in autoshaping, and the persistence of the recency effect in episodic memory across timescales.},

@article{Levy11,
	Abstract = {The responses of neurons in sensory cortex depend on the summation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. How the excitatory and inhibitory inputs scale with stimulus depends on the network architecture, which ranges from the lateral inhibitory configuration where excitatory inputs are more narrowly tuned than inhibitory inputs, to the co-tuned configuration where both are tuned equally. The underlying circuitry that gives rise to lateral inhibition and co-tuning is yet unclear. Using large-scale network simulations with experimentally determined connectivity patterns and simulations with rate models, we show that the spatial extent of the input determined the configuration: there was a smooth transition from lateral inhibition with narrow input to co-tuning with broad input. The transition from lateral inhibition to co-tuning was accompanied by shifts in overall gain (reduced), output firing pattern (from tonic to phasic) and rate-level functions (from non-monotonic to monotonically increasing). The results suggest that a single cortical network architecture could account for the extended range of experimentally observed response types between the extremes of lateral inhibitory versus co-tuned configurations. The cerebral cortex contains a network of electrically active cells (neurons) interconnected by synapses, which may be excitatory (tending to increase activity) or inhibitory. Network activity, i.e., the ensemble of activity patterns of the individual cells, is driven by input from the sense organs, and creates an internal representation of features of the outside world. In auditory cortex, sound frequency (pitch) is encoded by the physical location of activity in the network. Thus, connections among cells at various distances may blur or sharpen the frequency representation. Recent work in living animals has yielded conflicting results: sharpening of responses via lateral inhibition in some cases, versus balanced excitation and inhibition (co-tuning) in others. It was previously unknown whether a single cortical network architecture could account for this spectrum of findings. Here, computer simulations based on experimental data reveal that this is indeed the case. Varying input to the network causes smooth transitions between lateral inhibition and co-tuning, accompanied by changes in the strength and timing of the responses. Diverse input-dependent response patterns in a single network may be a general mechanism enabling the brain to process a wide range of sensory information under various conditions.},

@article{Battaglia11,
	Abstract = {Visually induced neuronal activity in V1 displays a marked gamma-band component which is modulated by stimulus properties. It has been argued that synchronized oscillations contribute to these gamma-band activity. However, analysis of Local Field Potentials ({LFPs}) across different experiments reveals considerable diversity in the degree of oscillatory behavior of this induced activity. Contrast-dependent power enhancements can indeed occur over a broad band in the gamma frequency range and spectral peaks may not arise at all. Furthermore, even when oscillations are observed, they undergo temporal decorrelation over very few cycles. This is not easily accounted for in previous network modeling of gamma oscillations. We argue here that interactions between cortical layers can be responsible for this fast decorrelation. We study a model of a V1 hypercolumn, embedding a simplified description of the multi-layered structure of the cortex. When the stimulus contrast is low, the induced activity is only weakly synchronous and the network resonates transiently without developing collective oscillations. When the contrast is high, on the other hand, the induced activity undergoes synchronous oscillations with an irregular spatiotemporal structure expressing a synchronous chaotic state. As a consequence the population activity undergoes fast temporal decorrelation, with concomitant rapid damping of the oscillations in {LFPs} autocorrelograms and peak broadening in {LFPs} power spectra. We show that the strength of the inter-layer coupling crucially affects this spatiotemporal structure. We predict that layer {VI} inactivation should induce global changes in the spectral properties of induced {LFPs}, reflecting their slower temporal decorrelation in the absence of inter-layer feedback. Finally, we argue that the mechanism underlying the emergence of synchronous chaos in our model is in fact very general. It stems from the fact that gamma oscillations induced by local delayed inhibition tend to develop chaos when coupled by sufficiently strong excitation.},

This simple approach to action-selection learning requires that information about sensory inputs be presented to the Bayesian decision stage in a suitably preprocessed form resulting from other adaptive processes (acting on a larger timescale) that detect salient dependencies among input features.

@article{Perdikis11,
	Abstract = {Traditional approaches to cognitive modelling generally portray cognitive events in terms of 'discrete' states (point attractor dynamics) rather than in terms of processes, thereby neglecting the time structure of cognition. In contrast, more recent approaches explicitly address this temporal dimension, but typically provide no entry points into cognitive categorization of events and experiences. With the aim to incorporate both these aspects, we propose a framework for functional architectures. Our approach is grounded in the notion that arbitrary complex (human) behaviour is decomposable into functional modes (elementary units), which we conceptualize as low-dimensional dynamical objects (structured flows on manifolds). The ensemble of modes at an agent's disposal constitutes his/her functional repertoire. The modes may be subjected to additional dynamics (termed operational signals), in particular, instantaneous inputs, and a mechanism that sequentially selects a mode so that it temporarily dominates the functional dynamics. The inputs and selection mechanisms act on faster and slower time scales then that inherent to the modes, respectively. The dynamics across the three time scales are coupled via feedback, rendering the entire architecture autonomous. We illustrate the functional architecture in the context of serial behaviour, namely cursive handwriting. Subsequently, we investigate the possibility of recovering the contributions of functional modes and operational signals from the output, which appears to be possible only when examining the output phase flow (i.e., not from trajectories in phase space or time). In most established approaches to cognitive modelling, cognitive events are treated as 'discrete' states, thus passing by the continuous nature of cognitive processes. In contrast, some novel approaches explicitly acknowledge cognition's temporal structure but provides no entry points into cognitive categorization of events and experiences. We attempt to incorporate both aspects in a new framework, which departs from the established idea that complex (human) behaviour is made up of elementary functional 'building blocks', referred to as modes. We model these as mathematical objects that are inherently dynamic (i.e., account for change over time). A mechanism sequentially selects the modes required and binds them together to compose complex behaviours. These modes may be subjected to brief inputs. The ensemble of these three ingredients, which influence one another and operate on different time scales, constitutes a functional architecture. We illustrate the architecture via cursive handwriting simulations, and investigate the possibility of recovering the contributions of the architecture from the written word. This appears possible only when focussing on the dynamic modes.},

@article{Chandrasekaran11,
	Abstract = {Speech production involves the movement of the mouth and other regions of the face resulting in visual motion cues. These visual cues enhance intelligibility and detection of auditory speech. As such, face-to-face speech is fundamentally a multisensory phenomenon. If speech is fundamentally multisensory, it should be reflected in the evolution of vocal communication: similar behavioral effects should be observed in other primates. Old World monkeys share with humans vocal production biomechanics and communicate face-to-face with vocalizations. It is unknown, however, if they, too, combine faces and voices to enhance their perception of vocalizations. We show that they do: monkeys combine faces and voices in noisy environments to enhance their detection of vocalizations. Their behavior parallels that of humans performing an identical task. We explored what common computational mechanism(s) could explain the pattern of results we observed across species. Standard explanations or models such as the principle of inverse effectiveness and a '' race'' model failed to account for their behavior patterns. Conversely, a '' superposition model'', positing the linear summation of activity patterns in response to visual and auditory components of vocalizations, served as a straightforward but powerful explanatory mechanism for the observed behaviors in both species. As such, it represents a putative homologous mechanism for integrating faces and voices across primates. The evolution of speech is one of our most fascinating and enduring mysteries---enduring partly because all the critical features of speech (brains, vocal tracts, ancestral speech-like sounds) do not fossilize. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly clear that speech is, by default, a multimodal phenomenon: we use both faces and voices together to communicate. Thus, understanding the evolution of speech requires a comparative approach using closely-related extant primate species and recognition that vocal communication is audiovisual. Using computer-generated avatar faces, we compared the integration of faces and voices in monkeys and humans performing an identical detection task. Both species responded faster when faces and voices were presented together relative to the face or voice alone. While the details sometimes appeared to differ, the behavior of both species could be well explained by a '' superposition'' model positing the linear summation of activity patterns in response to visual and auditory components of vocalizations. Other, more popular computational models of multisensory integration failed to explain our data. Thus, the superposition model represents a putative homologous mechanism for integrating faces and voices across primate species.},

	Abstract = {Collective navigation and swarming have been studied in animal groups, such as fish schools, bird flocks, bacteria, and slime molds. Computer modeling has shown that collective behavior of simple agents can result from simple interactions between the agents, which include short range repulsion, intermediate range alignment, and long range attraction. Here we study collective navigation of bacteria-inspired smart agents in complex terrains, with adaptive interactions that depend on performance. More specifically, each agent adjusts its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment -- by decreasing the peers' influence while navigating in a beneficial direction, and increasing it otherwise. We show that inclusion of such performance dependent adaptable interactions significantly improves the collective swarming performance, leading to highly efficient navigation, especially in complex terrains. Notably, to afford such adaptable interactions, each modeled agent requires only simple computational capabilities with short-term memory, which can easily be implemented in simple swarming robots. Many groups of organisms, from colonies of bacteria and social insects through schools of fish and flocks of birds to herds of mammals exhibit advanced collective navigation. Identifying the minimal features of biologically-inspired interacting agents that can lead to emergence of '' intelligent'' like collective navigation and decision making is fundamental to our understanding of collective behavior, and is of great interest in artificial intelligence and robotics. Previous models of collective behavior of agents, which relied on static interactions of repulsion, orientation (alignment), and attraction, have shown the emergence of collective swarming. Here we show the advantage of performance adaptable interactions for navigation of groups in complex terrains. Each agent senses the local environment and is then allowed to adjust its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment -- by decreasing the peers' influence while navigating in a beneficial direction and vice versa. We found that inclusion of such adaptable interactions dramatically improves the collective swarming performance leading to highly efficient navigation especially in very complex terrains.},

@article{Rzhetsky11,
	Abstract = {The use of structured knowledge representations---ontologies and terminologies---has become standard in biomedicine. Definitions of ontologies vary widely, as do the values and philosophies that underlie them. In seeking to make these views explicit, we conducted and summarized interviews with a dozen leading ontologists. Their views clustered into three broad perspectives that we summarize as mathematics, computer code, and Esperanto. Ontology as mathematics puts the ultimate premium on rigor and logic, symmetry and consistency of representation across scientific subfields, and the inclusion of only established, non-contradictory knowledge. Ontology as computer code focuses on utility and cultivates diversity, fitting ontologies to their purpose. Like computer languages C++, Prolog, and {HTML}, the code perspective holds that diverse applications warrant custom designed ontologies. Ontology as Esperanto focuses on facilitating cross-disciplinary communication, knowledge cross-referencing, and computation across datasets from diverse communities. We show how these views align with classical divides in science and suggest how a synthesis of their concerns could strengthen the next generation of biomedical ontologies.},

	Abstract = {Visual tracking in video sequences is a widely developed topic in computer vision applications. However, the emergence of panoramic vision using catadioptric sensors has created the need for new approaches in order to track an object in this type of images. Indeed the non-linear resolution and the geometric distortions due to the insertion of the mirror, make tracking in catadioptric images a very challenging task. This paper describes particle filter for tracking moving object over time using a catadioptric sensor. In this work different problems due to the specificities of the catadioptric systems such as geometry are considered. The obtained results demonstrate an important improvement of the tracking accuracy with our adapted method and a better robustness to clutter background and light changes.},

	Abstract = {We have built a phenomenological spiking model of the cat early visual system comprising the retina, the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus ({LGN}) and V1's layer 4, and established four main results (1) When exposed to videos that reproduce with high fidelity what a cat experiences under natural conditions, adjacent Retinal Ganglion Cells ({RGCs}) have spike-time correlations at a short timescale (\~{}30 ms), despite neuronal noise and possible jitter accumulation. (2) In accordance with recent experimental findings, the {LGN} filters out some noise. It thus increases the spike reliability and temporal precision, the sparsity, and, importantly, further decreases down to \~{}15 ms adjacent cells' correlation timescale. (3) Downstream simple cells in V1's layer 4, if equipped with Spike {Timing-Dependent} Plasticity ({STDP}), may detect these fine-scale cross-correlations, and thus connect principally to {ON}- and {OFF}-centre cells with Receptive Fields ({RF}) aligned in the visual space, and thereby become orientation selective, in accordance with Hubel and Wiesel (Journal of Physiology 160:106--154, 1962 ) classic model. Up to this point we dealt with continuous vision, and there was no absolute time reference such as a stimulus onset, yet information was encoded and decoded in the relative spike times. (4) We then simulated saccades to a static image and benchmarked relative spike time coding and time-to-first spike coding w.r.t. to saccade landing in the context of orientation representation. In both the retina and the {LGN}, relative spike times are more precise, less affected by pre-landing history and global contrast than absolute ones, and lead to robust contrast invariant orientation representations in V1.},

These methods usually fail to capture motion of objects with intensity evolution. We propose a new approach to solve the motion computation problem with a different type of constancy hypothesis. Because we are mainly interested in deformable moving structures, we postulate that such a structure, within a temporal image sequence, is associated with a constant volume or a constant total intensity over time. We call this postulate it the volume conservation hypothesis. Results are displayed for clouds motion and deformation on meteorological satellites images.},

	Abstract = {The {OPERA} neutrino experiment at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory has measured the velocity of neutrinos from the {CERN} {CNGS} beam over a baseline of about 730 km with much higher accuracy than previous studies conducted with accelerator neutrinos. The measurement is based on high-statistics data taken by {OPERA} in the years 2009, 2010 and 2011. Dedicated upgrades of the {CNGS} timing system and of the {OPERA} detector, as well as a high precision geodesy campaign for the measurement of the neutrino baseline, allowed reaching comparable systematic and statistical accuracies. An early arrival time of {CNGS} muon neutrinos with respect to the one computed assuming the speed of light in vacuum of (60.7 \\\\pm 6.9 (stat.) \\\\pm 7.4 (sys.)) ns was measured. This anomaly corresponds to a relative difference of the muon neutrino velocity with respect to the speed of light (v-c)/c = (2.48 \\\\pm 0.28 (stat.) \\\\pm 0.30 (sys.)) \\\\times 10-5.},

This introduction discusses the contributions collected in the present Theme Issue. We highlight the potential and challenges of a complex systems approach to develop an understanding of the brain in general and the sleeping brain in particular. Basically, we focus on two topics: the complex networks approach to understand the changes in the functional connectivity of the brain during sleep, and the complex dynamics of sleep, including sleep regulation. We hope that this Theme Issue will stimulate and intensify the interdisciplinary communication to advance our understanding of the complex dynamics of the brain that underlies sleep and consciousness.},

@article{McDermott11,
	Abstract = {Rainstorms, insect swarms, and galloping horses produce sound texturesthe collective result of many similar acoustic events. Sound textures are distinguished by temporal homogeneity, suggesting they could be recognized with time-averaged statistics. To test this hypothesis, we processed real-world textures with an auditory model containing filters tuned for sound frequencies and their modulations, and measured statistics of the resulting decomposition. We then assessed the realism and recognizability of novel sounds synthesized to have matching statistics. Statistics of individual frequency channels, capturing spectral power and sparsity, generally failed to produce compelling synthetic textures; however, combining them with correlations between channels produced identifiable and natural-sounding textures. Synthesis quality declined if statistics were computed from biologically implausible auditory models. The results suggest that sound texture perception is mediated by relatively simple statistics of early auditory representations, presumably computed by downstream neural populations. The synthesis methodology offers a powerful tool for their further investigation. º Sound textures can be synthesized from summary statistics measured in natural sounds º Realism degrades when subsets of statistics are omitted or perturbed º Realism also degrades when biologically implausible statistics are used º Suggests texture statistics are computed by auditory system, used for recognition},

@article{Eichhorn09,
	Abstract = {Orientation selectivity is the most striking feature of simple cell coding in V1 that has been shown to emerge from the reduction of higher-order correlations in natural images in a large variety of statistical image models. The most parsimonious one among these models is linear Independent Component Analysis ({ICA}), whereas second-order decorrelation transformations such as Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) do not yield oriented filters. Because of this finding, it has been suggested that the emergence of orientation selectivity may be explained by higher-order redundancy reduction. To assess the tenability of this hypothesis, it is an important empirical question how much more redundancy can be removed with {ICA} in comparison to {PCA} or other second-order decorrelation methods. Although some previous studies have concluded that the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images is generally insignificant, other studies reported an extra gain for {ICA} of more than 100\%. A consistent conclusion about the role of higher-order correlations in natural images can be reached only by the development of reliable quantitative evaluation methods. Here, we present a very careful and comprehensive analysis using three evaluation criteria related to redundancy reduction: In addition to the multi-information and the average log-loss, we compute complete rate--distortion curves for {ICA} in comparison with {PCA}. Without exception, we find that the advantage of the {ICA} filters is small. At the same time, we show that a simple spherically symmetric distribution with only two parameters can fit the data significantly better than the probabilistic model underlying {ICA}. This finding suggests that, although the amount of higher-order correlation in natural images can in fact be significant, the feature of orientation selectivity does not yield a large contribution to redundancy reduction within the linear filter bank models of V1 simple cells. Since the Nobel Prize winning work of Hubel and Wiesel it has been known that orientation selectivity is an important feature of simple cells in the primary visual cortex. The standard description of this stage of visual processing is that of a linear filter bank where each neuron responds to an oriented edge at a certain location within the visual field. From a vision scientist's point of view, we would like to understand why an orientation selective filter bank provides a useful image representation. Several previous studies have shown that orientation selectivity arises when the individual filter shapes are optimized according to the statistics of natural images. Here, we investigate quantitatively how critical the feature of orientation selectivity is for this optimization. We find that there is a large range of non-oriented filter shapes that perform nearly as well as the optimal orientation selective filters. We conclude that the standard filter bank model is not suitable to reveal a strong link between orientation selectivity and the statistics of natural images. Thus, to understand the role of orientation selectivity in the primary visual cortex, we will have to develop more sophisticated, nonlinear models of natural images.},

@article{Girshick11,
	Abstract = {Humans are good at performing visual tasks, but experimental measurements have revealed substantial biases in the perception of basic visual attributes. An appealing hypothesis is that these biases arise through a process of statistical inference, in which information from noisy measurements is fused with a probabilistic model of the environment. However, such inference is optimal only if the observer's internal model matches the environment. We found this to be the case. We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers' internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs. In addition, we determined how a neural population could embed probabilistic information responsible for such biases.},

@article{Lyu09,
	Abstract = {We consider the problem of efficiently encoding a signal by transforming it to a new representation whose components are statistically independent. A widely studied linear solution, known as independent component analysis ({ICA}), exists for the case when the signal is generated as a linear transformation of independent nongaussian sources. Here, we examine a complementary case, in which the source is nongaussian and elliptically symmetric. In this case, no invertible linear transform suffices to decompose the signal into independent components, but we show that a simple nonlinear transformation, which we call radial gaussianization ({RG}), is able to remove all dependencies. We then examine this methodology in the context of natural image statistics. We first show that distributions of spatially proximal bandpass filter responses are better described as elliptical than as linearly transformed independent sources. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the reduction in dependency achieved by applying {RG} to either nearby pairs or blocks of bandpass filter responses is significantly greater than that achieved by {ICA}. Finally, we show that the {RG} transformation may be closely approximated by divisive normalization, which has been used to model the nonlinear response properties of visual neurons.},

	Abstract = {It is becoming increasingly apparent that brain oscillations in various frequency bands play important roles in perceptual and attentional processes. Understandably, most of the associated experimental evidence comes from human or animal electrophysiological studies, allowing direct access to the oscillatory activities. However, such periodicities in perception and attention should, in theory, also be observable using the proper psychophysical tools. Here, we review a number of psychophysical techniques that have been used by us and other authors, in successful and sometimes unsuccessful attempts, to reveal the rhythmic nature of perceptual and attentional processes. We argue that the two existing and largely distinct debates about discrete vs. continuous perception and parallel vs. sequential attention should in fact be regarded as two facets of the same question: how do brain rhythms shape the psychological operations of perception and attention?},

Whereas much effort has been put in developing fast optimization techniques when the groups are disjoint or embedded in a hierarchy, we address here the case of general overlapping groups. To this end, we present two different strategies: On the one hand, we show that the proximal operator associated with a sum of l\_infinity-norms can be computed exactly in polynomial time by solving a quadratic min-cost flow problem, allowing the use of accelerated proximal gradient methods. On the other hand, we use proximal splitting techniques, and address an equivalent formulation with non-overlapping groups, but in higher dimension and with additional constraints. We propose efficient and scalable algorithms exploiting these two strategies, which are significantly faster than alternative approaches. We illustrate these methods with several problems such as {CUR} matrix factorization, multi-task learning of tree-structured dictionaries, background subtraction in video sequences, image denoising with wavelets, and topographic dictionary learning of natural image patches.},

@article{Rosenzweig96,
	Abstract = {Supporting Hebb's 1949 hypothesis of use-induced plasticity of the nervous system, our group found in the 1960s that training or differential experience induced neurochemical changes in cerebral cortex of the rat and regional changes in weight of cortex. Further studies revealed changes in cortical thickness, size of synaptic contacts, number of dendritic spines, and dendritic branching. Similar effects were found whether rats were assigned to differential experience at weaning (25 days of age), as young adults (105 days) or as adults (285 days). Enriched early experience improved performance on several tests of learning. Cerebral results of experience in an enriched environment are similar to results of formal training. Enriched experience and training appear to evoke the same cascade of neurochemical events in causing plastic changes in brain. Sufficiently rich experience may be necessary for full growth of species-specific brain characteristics and behavioral potential. Clayton and Krebs found in 1994 that birds that normally store food have larger hippocampi than related species that do not store. This difference develops only in birds given the opportunity to store and recover food. Research on use-induced plasticity is being applied to promote child development, successful aging, and recovery from brain damage; it is also being applied to benefit animals in laboratories, zoos and farms.},

@article{Davison08,
	Abstract = {Computational neuroscience has produced a diversity of software for simulations of networks of spiking neurons, with both negative and positive consequences. On the one hand, each simulator uses its own programming or configuration language, leading to considerable difficulty in porting models from one simulator to another. This impedes communication between investigators and makes it harder to reproduce and build on the work of others. On the other hand, simulation results can be cross-checked between different simulators, giving greater confidence in their correctness, and each simulator has different optimizations, so the most appropriate simulator can be chosen for a given modelling task. A common programming interface to multiple simulators would reduce or eliminate the problems of simulator diversity while retaining the benefits. {PyNN} is such an interface, making it possible to write a simulation script once, using the Python programming language, and run it without modification on any supported simulator (currently {NEURON}, {NEST}, {PCSIM}, Brian and the Heidelberg {VLSI} neuromorphic hardware). {PyNN} increases the productivity of neuronal network modelling by providing high-level abstraction, by promoting code sharing and reuse, and by providing a foundation for simulator-agnostic analysis, visualization and data-management tools. {PyNN} increases the reliability of modelling studies by making it much easier to check results on multiple simulators. {PyNN} is open-source software and is available from {http://neuralensemble.org/PyNN}.},

@article{Clarac09,
	Abstract = {This article reviews the scientific contributions of Jacques Paillard (1920--2006), who strengthened substantially the role of physiological psychology in the field of movement neuroscience. His research began in 1947 under the direction of the French neurophysiologist, Alfred Fessard (1900--1982), with whom he then collaborated for 9 years while an undergraduate and then graduate student and junior faculty member in psychology at the University of Paris (the Sorbonne). Paillard moved to the University of Marseille in 1957 as a Professor of Psychophysiology. In parallel, he became a founding member and administrator of the Institute of Neurophysiology and Psychophysiology, which began in 1963 on the Marseille campus of the National Center of Scientific Research ({CNRS}). Paillard retired from his university and {CNRS} positions in 1991 but he continued seminal research until his demise. Paillard advanced understanding of higher brain influences on human spinal motor mechanisms and the functional role of proprioception as revealed in patients deprived of such sensibility. He remains best known, however, for his work on human motor cognition. He reasoned that brain '' maps'' of the external world are constructed by the body's own movements and the central effects of their resulting central and peripheral feedback. He proposed two levels of interactive brain processing for the planning and/or execution of a reaching movement: 1) a sensorimotor level, using body posture as a key reference; and 2) a '' higher'' cognitive level for accurate movement performance, using learned representations of the position and shape of the environmental components, including the body, itself.},

	Abstract = {Recently, statistical techniques have been used to assist art historians in the analysis of works of art. We present a novel technique for the quantification of artistic style that utilizes a sparse coding model. Originally developed in vision research, sparse coding models can be trained to represent any image space by maximizing the kurtosis of a representation of an arbitrarily selected image from that space. We apply such an analysis to successfully distinguish a set of authentic drawings by Pieter Bruegel the Elder from another set of well-known Bruegel imitations. We show that our approach, which involves a direct comparison based on a single relevant statistic, offers a natural and potentially more germane alternative to wavelet-based classification techniques that rely on more complicated statistical frameworks. Specifically, we show that our model provides a method capable of discriminating between authentic and imitation Bruegel drawings that numerically outperforms well-known existing approaches. Finally, we discuss the applications and constraints of our technique.},

@article{Reisbeck99,
	Abstract = {We determined two-dimensional motion discrimination contours in the spatio-temporal frequency plane to characterize the mechanisms underlying velocity perception. In particular, we wanted to determine whether there exist mechanisms tuned specifically to velocity, rather than separable mechanisms tuned to spatial and temporal frequency. A {4-AFC} paradigm was used to determine spatio-temporal frequency discrimination thresholds for moving sinewave gratings defined by luminance contrast. Three of the grating patches used were defined by the same spatial and temporal frequency (standard), the other (test) differed by a fixed proportional change in spatial and temporal frequency. Subjects had to indicate which grating differed most from the others and the thresholds determined for varying proportions of change in spatial and temporal frequency were used to trace out complete threshold contours in the plane spanned by these attributes. Some of the contours, primarily at speeds above 1 deg/s, were noticeably oriented along lines of constant velocity. To further isolate these mechanisms, spatio-temporal noise was added to the standard stimuli either along a line of constant velocity or in the direction orthogonal to it. When spatio-temporal noise of constant velocity was added to the standard stimuli, threshold contours became elongated only along the direction of the noise. The same amount of noise in the orthogonal direction produced an overall increase in thresholds without changing the shape of the contour, presenting clear evidence for velocity tuned mechanisms. In further experiments we discovered that velocity tuned mechanisms interact with separable mechanisms to produce optimal discriminability. Analogous experiments with isoluminant stimuli failed to exhibit evidence for velocity tuning, supporting the notion that the human color vision system is impaired in its coding of stimulus speed, despite excellent sensitivity to direction of motion.},

@article{Rochefort11,
	Abstract = {Previous studies of the ferret visual cortex indicate that the development of direction selectivity requires visual experience. Here, we used two-photon calcium imaging to study the development of direction selectivity in layer 2/3 neurons of the mouse visual cortex in vivo. Surprisingly, just after eye opening nearly all orientation-selective neurons were also direction selective. During later development, the number of neurons responding to drifting gratings increased in parallel with the fraction of neurons that were orientation, but not direction, selective. Our experiments demonstrate that direction selectivity develops normally in dark-reared mice, indicating that the early development of direction selectivity is independent of visual experience. Furthermore, remarkable functional similarities exist between the development of direction selectivity in cortical neurons and the previously reported development of direction selectivity in the mouse retina. Together, these findings provide strong evidence that the development of orientation and direction selectivity in the mouse brain is distinctly different from that in ferrets.},

@article{Liu11a,
	Abstract = {Orientation selectivity ({OS}) is an emergent property in the primary visual cortex (V1). How {OS} arises from synaptic circuits remains unsolved. Here, in vivo whole-cell recordings in the mouse V1 revealed that simple cells received broadly tuned excitation and even more broadly tuned inhibition. Excitation and inhibition shared a similar orientation preference and temporally overlapped substantially. Neuron modeling and dynamic-clamp recording further revealed that excitatory inputs alone would result in membrane potential responses with significantly attenuated selectivity, due to a saturating input-output function of the membrane filtering. Inhibition ameliorated the attenuation of excitatory selectivity by expanding the input dynamic range and caused additional sharpening of output responses beyond unselectively suppressing responses at all orientations. This "blur-sharpening" effect allows selectivity conveyed by excitatory inputs to be better expressed, which may be a general mechanism underlying the generation of feature-selective responses in the face of strong excitatory inputs that are weakly biased.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new automatic segmentation scheme that combines active appearance ({AAM}) modeling and patch-based label fusion into a segmentation framework. {AAM}, which uses eigen-decomposition to analyze the statistical variation of image intensity and shape infor- mation over the population, is used to capture the global shape char- acteristics of the structure of interest with a generative model, while patch-based label fusion, which uses a non-local means method to com- pare the image local intensity properties, is applied to locally refine the segmentation results along the structure boundary area to improve the segmentation accuracy. The proposed segmentation scheme is used to segment human medial temporal lobe structures, which have low inten- sity contrast in {MRI} and complexity in shape. The experiments demon- strate that this new segmentation scheme is computationally efficient and robust. In a leave-one out validation with fifty-four normal young subjects, the method yields a mean Dice κ of 0.87 for hippocampus, 0.81 for amygdala, 0.73 for para-hippocampal complex cortex, and 0.73 for perirhinal cortex between manual and automatic labels.},

	Abstract = {Autonomous guidance of {Micro-Air} Vehicles ({MAVs}) in unknown environments is a challenging task because these artificial creatures have small aeromechanical time constants, which make them prone to be disturbed by gusts of wind. Flying insects are subject to quite similar kinds of disturbances, yet they navigate swiftly and deftly. Flying insects display highperformance visuo-motor control systems that have stood the test of time. They can therefore teach us how vision can be used for immediate and vital actions. We built a 50-gram tethered aerial demonstrator, called {OSCAR} {II}, which manages to keep its gaze steadily fixating a target (a dark edge), in spite of nasty thumps that we deliberately gave to its body with a custom-made "slapping machine". The robot's agile yaw reactions are based on: - a mechanical decoupling of the eye from the body - an active coupling of the robot's heading with its gaze - a Visual Fixation Reflex ({VFR}) - a {Vestibulo-Ocular} Reflex ({VOR}) - an accurate and fast actuator (Voice Coil Motor, {VCM}) The actuator is a 2.4-gram voice coil motor that is able to rotate the eye with a rise time as small as 12ms, that is, much shorter than the rise time of human oculo-motor saccades. In connection with a micro-rate gyro, this actuator endows the robot with a high performance "vestibulo ocular reflex" that keeps the gaze locked onto the target whatever perturbations in yaw affect the robot's body. Whenever the robot is destabilized (e.g., by a slap applied on one side), the gaze keeps fixating the target, while being the reference to which the robot's heading is servoed. It then takes the robot only 0:6s to realign its heading with its gaze.},

There are a variety of examples of this that currently lack a satisfactory explanation. In this paper, we demonstrate that distinct classes of asymmetries may be explained by virtue of a few simple conditions that are consistent with current thinking surrounding computational modeling of visual search and coding in the primate brain. This includes a detailed look at the role that stimulus familiarity plays in the determination of search performance. Overall, we demonstrate that all of these asymmetries have a common origin, namely, they are a consequence of the encoding that appears in the visual cortex. The analysis associated with these cases yields insight into the problem of visual search in general and predictions of novel search asymmetries.},

	Abstract = {Biological motor control provides highly effective solutions to difficult control problems in spite of the complexity of the plant and the significant delays in sensory feedback . Such delays are expected to lead to non trivial stability issues and lack of robustness of control solutions. However, such difficulties are not observed in biological systems under normal operating conditions. Based on early suggestions in the control literature, a possible solution to this conundrum has been the suggestion that the motor system contains within itself a forward model of the plant (e.g., the arm), which allows the system to `simulate' and predict the effect of applying a control signal. In this work we formally define the notion of a forward model for deterministic control problems, and provide simple conditions that imply its existence for tasks involving delayed feedback control. As opposed to previous work which dealt mostly with linear plants and quadratic cost functions, our results apply to rather generic control systems, showing that any controller (biological or otherwise) which solves a set of tasks, \\\\emph{must} contain within itself a forward plant model. We suggest that our results provide strong theoretical support for the necessity of forward models in many delayed control problems, implying that they are not only useful, but rather, mandatory, under general conditions.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present the concept of diffusing models to perform image-to-image matching. Having two images to match, the main idea is to consider the objects boundaries in one image as semi-permeable membranes and to let the other image, considered as a deformable grid model, diffuse through these interfaces, by the action of effectors situated within the membranes. We illustrate this concept by an analogy with Maxwell's demons. We show that this concept relates to more traditional ones, based on attraction, with an intermediate step being optical flow techniques. We use the concept of diffusing models to derive three different non-rigid matching algorithms, one using all the intensity levels in the static image, one using only contour points, and a last one operating on already segmented images. Finally, we present results with synthesized deformations and real medical images, with applications to heart motion tracking and three-dimensional inter-patients matching.},

	Abstract = {Diffusion tensor imaging provides information about deep white matter anatomy that structural magnetic resonance images typically fail to resolve. Non-linear registration of diffusion tensor images, for which a few methods already exist, allows us to capture the deformations of these structures that would otherwise go unobserved. Here, we build on an existing method for diffeomorphic registration of diffusion tensor images, so that it fully incorporates the useful log-domain parameterization of diffeomorphisms. Initially, this allows us to easily include a registration symmetry constraint that is highly desirable for pair-wise registration. More importantly, the parameterization allows simple and proper calculation of statistics on the transformations obtained. We show that the symmetric log-domain method exhibits the most preferable trade-off between image correspondence and deformation smoothness on real data and also achieves the best recovery of synthetic warps.},

@article{Zhao11,
	Abstract = {Spectro-temporal receptive fields ({STRFs}) have been widely used as linear approximations to the signal transform from sound spectrograms to neural responses along the auditory pathway. Their dependence on statistical attributes of the stimuli, such as sound intensity, is usually explained by nonlinear mechanisms and models. Here, we apply an efficient coding principle which has been successfully used to understand receptive fields in early stages of visual processing, in order to provide a computational understanding of the {STRFs}. According to this principle, {STRFs} result from an optimal tradeoff between maximizing the sensory information the brain receives, and minimizing the cost of the neural activities required to represent and transmit this information. Both terms depend on the statistical properties of the sensory inputs and the noise that corrupts them. The {STRFs} should therefore depend on the input power spectrum and the signal-to-noise ratio, which is assumed to increase with input intensity. We analytically derive the optimal {STRFs} when signal and noise are approximated as Gaussians. Under the constraint that they should be spectro-temporally local, the {STRFs} are predicted to adapt from being band-pass to low-pass filters as the input intensity reduces, or the input correlation becomes longer range in sound frequency or time. These predictions qualitatively match physiological observations. Our prediction as to how the {STRFs} should be determined by the input power spectrum could readily be tested, since this spectrum depends on the stimulus ensemble. The potentials and limitations of the efficient coding principle are discussed. Spectro-temporal receptive fields ({STRFs}) have been widely used as linear approximations of the signal transform from sound spectrograms to neural responses along the auditory pathway. Their dependence on the ensemble of input stimuli has usually been examined mechanistically as a possibly complex nonlinear process. We propose that the {STRFs} and their dependence on the input ensemble can be understood by an efficient coding principle, according to which the responses of the encoding neurons report the maximum amount of information about the sensory input, subject to limits on the neural cost in representing and transmitting information. This proposal is inspired by the success of the same principle in accounting for receptive fields in the early stages of the visual pathway and their adaptation to input statistics. The principle can account for the {STRFs} that have been observed, and the way they change with sound intensity. Further, it predicts how the {STRFs} should change with input correlations, an issue that has not been extensively investigated. In sum, our study provides a computational understanding of the neural transformations of auditory inputs, and makes testable predictions for future experiments.},

	Abstract = {Two recent papers ( and ) report that neuropsychological patients with a profound object recognition problem (visual agnosic subjects) show differences from healthy observers in the way their eye movements are controlled when looking at images. The interpretation of these papers is that eye movements can be modeled as the selection of points on a saliency map, and that agnosic subjects show an increased reliance on visual saliency, i.e., brightness and contrast in low-level stimulus features. Here we review this approach and present new data from our own experiments with an agnosic patient that quantifies the relationship between saliency and fixation location. In addition, we consider whether the perceptual difficulties of individual patients might be modeled by selectively weighting the different features involved in a saliency map. Our data indicate that saliency is not always a good predictor of fixation in agnosia: even for our agnosic subject, as for normal observers, the saliency--fixation relationship varied as a function of the task. This means that top--down processes still have a significant effect on the earliest stages of scanning in the setting of visual agnosia, indicating severe limitations for the saliency map model. Top--down, active strategies--which are the hallmark of our human visual system--play a vital role in eye movement control, whether we know what we are looking at or not.},

@article{Grossberg11,
	Abstract = {Invariant recognition of objects depends on a hierarchy of cortical stages that build invariance gradually. Binocular disparity computations are a key part of this transformation. Cortical area V1 computes absolute disparity, which is the horizontal difference in retinal location of an image in the left and right foveas. Many cells in cortical area V2 compute relative disparity, which is the difference in absolute disparity of two visible features. Relative, but not absolute, disparity is invariant under both a disparity change across a scene and vergence eye movements. A neural network model is introduced which predicts that shunting lateral inhibition of disparity-sensitive layer 4 cells in V2 causes a peak shift in cell responses that transforms absolute disparity from V1 into relative disparity in V2. This inhibitory circuit has previously been implicated in contrast gain control, divisive normalization, selection of perceptual groupings, and attentional focusing. The model hereby links relative disparity to other visual functions and thereby suggests new ways to test its mechanistic basis. Other brain circuits are reviewed wherein lateral inhibition causes a peak shift that influences behavioral responses.},

@article{Bushnell11,
	Abstract = {Past studies of shape coding in visual cortical area V4 have demonstrated that neurons can accurately represent isolated shapes in terms of their component contour features. However, rich natural scenes contain many partially occluded objects, which have '' accidental'' contours at the junction between the occluded and occluding objects. These contours do not represent the true shape of the occluded object and are known to be perceptually discounted. To discover whether V4 neurons differentially encode accidental contours, we studied the responses of single neurons in fixating monkeys to complex shapes and contextual stimuli presented either in isolation or adjoining each other to provide a percept of partial occlusion. Responses to preferred contours were suppressed when the adjoining context rendered those contours accidental. The observed suppression was reversed when the partial occlusion percept was compromised by introducing a small gap between the component stimuli. Control experiments demonstrated that these results likely depend on contour geometry at T-junctions and cannot be attributed to mechanisms based solely on local color/luminance contrast, spatial proximity of stimuli, or the spatial frequency content of images. Our findings provide novel insights into how occluded objects, which are fundamental to complex visual scenes, are encoded in area V4. They also raise the possibility that the weakened encoding of accidental contours at the junction between objects could mark the first step of image segmentation along the ventral visual pathway.},

@article{Kane11,
	Abstract = {The response of motion-selective neurons in primary visual cortex is ambiguous with respect to the two-dimensional ({2D}) velocity of spatially extensive objects. To investigate how local neural activity is integrated in the computation of global motion, we asked observers to judge the direction of a rigidly translating natural scene viewed through 16 apertures. We report a novel relative oblique effect: local contour orientations parallel or orthogonal to the direction of motion yield more precise and less biased estimates of direction than other orientations. This effect varies inversely with the local orientation variance of the natural scenes. Analysis of contour orientations across aperture pairings extends previous research on plaids and indicates that observers are biased toward the faster moving contour for Type I pairings. Finally, we show that observers' bias and precision as a function of the orientation statistics of natural scenes can be accounted for by an interaction between naturally arising anisotropies in natural scenes and a template model of {MT} that is optimally tuned for isotropic stimuli.},

@article{Lin05,
	Abstract = {To examine the network-level organizing principles by which the brain achieves its real-time encoding of episodic information, we have developed a 96-channel array to simultaneously record the activity patterns of as many as 260 individual neurons in the mouse hippocampus during various startling episodes. We find that the mnemonic startling episodes triggered firing changes in a set of {CA1} neurons in both startle-type and environment-dependent manners. Pattern classification methods reveal that these firing changes form distinct ensemble representations in a low-dimensional encoding subspace. Application of a sliding window technique further enabled us to reliably capture not only the temporal dynamics of real-time network encoding but also postevent processing of newly formed ensemble traces. Our analyses revealed that the network-encoding power is derived from a set of functional coding units, termed neural cliques, in the {CA1} network. The individual neurons within neural cliques exhibit '' collective cospiking'' dynamics that allow the neural clique to overcome the response variability of its members and to achieve real-time encoding robustness. Conversion of activation patterns of these coding unit assemblies into a set of real-time digital codes permits concise and universal representation and categorization of discrete behavioral episodes across different individual brains.},

@article{Chakravarthi11,
	Abstract = {Binding of features helps object recognition in contour integration but hinders it in crowding. In contour integration, aligned adjacent objects group together to form a path. In crowding, flanking objects make the target unidentifiable. However, to date, the two tasks have only been studied separately. K. A. May and R. F. Hess (2007) suggested that the same binding mediates both tasks. To test this idea, we ask observers to perform two different tasks with the same stimulus. We present oriented grating patches that form a "snake letter" in the periphery. Observers report either the identity of the whole letter (contour integration task) or the phase of one of the grating patches (crowding task). We manipulate the strength of binding between gratings by varying the alignment between them, i.e., the Gestalt goodness of continuation, measured as "wiggle." We find that better alignment strengthens binding, which improves contour integration and worsens crowding. Observers show equal sensitivity to alignment in these two very different tasks, suggesting that the same binding mechanism underlies both phenomena. It has been claimed that grouping among flankers reduces their crowding of the target. Instead, we find that these published cases of weak crowding are due to weak binding resulting from target-flanker misalignment. We conclude that crowding is mediated solely by the grouping of flankers with the target and is independent of grouping among flankers.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a new spatiotemporal filtering scheme is described for noise reduction in video sequences. For this purpose, the scheme processes each group of three consecutive sequence frames in two steps: 1) estimate motion between frames and 2) use motion vectors to get the final denoised current frame. A family of adaptive spatiotemporal L-filters is applied. A recursive implementation of these filters is used and compared with its nonrecursive counterpart. The motion trajectories are obtained recursively by a region-recursive estimation method. Both motion parameters and filter weights are computed by minimizing the kurtosis of error instead of mean squared error. Using the kurtosis in the algorithms adaptation is appropriate in the presence of mixed and impulsive noises. The filter performance is evaluated by considering different types of video sequences. Simulations show marked improvement in visual quality and {SNRI} measures cost as well as compared to those reported in literature.},

To make this comparison, we first consider an abstract ecosystem composed of a single limiting resource and a single microbial species that are carried by advection. In a second stage, we consider another microbial species in competition for the same limiting resource. Comparing the numerical solutions of the two models, we found that the numerical accuracy of simulations of advective transport models performed with {MIN3P} depends on the evolution of the concentrations of the microbial species: when the state of the system is close to a non-hyperbolic equilibrium, we observe a numerical inaccuracy that may be due to the discretization method used in numerical approximations of reactive transport equations. Therefore, one has to be cautious about the predictions given by the models.},

	Abstract = {This paper introduces the generalized forward-backward splitting algorithm for minimizing convex functions of the form \\\\$F + \\\\\\\\sum\_{i=1}^n G\_i\\\\$, where \\\\$F\\\\$ has a Lipschitz-continuous gradient and the \\\\$G\_i\\\\$'s are simple in the sense that their Moreau proximity operators are easy to compute. While the forward-backward algorithm cannot deal with more than \\\\$n = 1\\\\$ non-smooth function, our method generalizes it to the case of arbitrary \\\\$n\\\\$. Our method makes an explicit use of the regularity of \\\\$F\\\\$ in the forward step, and the proximity operators of the \\\\$G\_i\\\\$'s are applied in parallel in the backward step. This allows the generalized forward backward to efficiently address an important class of convex problems. We prove its convergence in infinite dimension, and its robustness to errors on the computation of the proximity operators and of the gradient of \\\\$F\\\\$. Examples on inverse problems in imaging demonstrate the advantage of the proposed methods in comparison to other splitting algorithms.},

@article{Burroughs11,
	Abstract = {Immune synapses formed by T and {NK} cells both show segregation of the integrin {ICAM1} from other proteins such as {CD2} (T cell) or {KIR} ({NK} cell). However, the mechanism by which these proteins segregate remains unclear; one key hypothesis is a redistribution based on protein size. Simulations of this mechanism qualitatively reproduce observed segregation patterns, but only in certain parameter regimes. Verifying that these parameter constraints in fact hold has not been possible to date, this requiring a quantitative coupling of theory to experimental data. Here, we address this challenge, developing a new methodology for analysing and quantifying image data and its integration with biophysical models. Specifically we fit a binding kinetics model to 2 colour fluorescence data for cytoskeleton independent synapses (2 and {3D}) and test whether the observed inverse correlation between fluorophores conforms to size dependent exclusion, and further, whether patterned states are predicted when model parameters are estimated on individual synapses. All synapses analysed satisfy these conditions demonstrating that the mechanisms of protein redistribution have identifiable signatures in their spatial patterns. We conclude that energy processes implicit in protein size based segregation can drive the patternation observed in individual synapses, at least for the specific examples tested, such that no additional processes need to be invoked. This implies that biophysical processes within the membrane interface have a crucial impact on cell:cell communication and cell signalling, governing protein interactions and protein aggregation. A cell interacts with its environment though the thousands of proteins that are expressed on the cell's surface. A number of these proteins are involved in cell:cell communication, a complex process where two cells establish a (transient) contact interface forming protein bonds that bridge the interface. In T cells, which are a major component of the immune system, the proteins in this interface are organised into spatial domains with small proteins segregating from large ones, a patternation that is believed to be a crucial step in the recognition of antigens by T cells. The mechanism of this patternation is still unresolved, a mechanism based on maximising the number of bonds by partitioning the interface into regions where short and long proteins can form bonds being the most promising. Here we directly compare image patterns with a mathematical theory of patternation demonstrating that there is a signature of the patternation mechanism in the image data. We developed a framework for quantitative modelling of image data in a biophysical context that can be utilised in a variety of other model validation studies. Using these methods we proved that on these images this theory is sufficient to explain the observed patternation.},

@article{Burgi00,
	Abstract = {We develop a theory for the temporal integration of visual motion motivated by psychophysical experiments. The theory proposes that input data are temporally grouped and used to predict and estimate the motion flows in the image sequence. This temporal grouping can be considered a generalization of the data association techniques that engineers use to study motion sequences. Our temporal grouping theory is expressed in terms of the Bayesian generalization of standard Kalman filtering. To implement the theory, we derive a parallel network that shares some properties of cortical networks. Computer simulations of this network demonstrate that our theory qualitatively accounts for psychophysical experiments on motion occlusion and motion outliers. In deriving our theory, we assumed spatial factorizability of the probability distributions and made the approximation of updating the marginal distributions of velocity at each point. This allowed us to perform local computations and simplified our implementation. We argue that these approximations are suitable for the stimuli we are considering (for which spatial coherence effects are negligible).},

	Abstract = {An important problem in neuronal computation is to discern how features of stimuli control the timing of action potentials. One aspect of this problem is to determine how an action potential, or spike, can be elicited with the least energy cost, e.g., a minimal amount of applied current. Here we show in the Hodgkin \& Huxley model of the action potential and in experiments on squid giant axons that: 1) spike generation in a neuron can be highly discriminatory for stimulus shape and 2) the optimal stimulus shape is dependent upon inputs to the neuron. We show how polarity and time course of post-synaptic currents determine which of these optimal stimulus shapes best excites the neuron. These results are obtained mathematically using the calculus of variations and experimentally using a stochastic search methodology. Our findings reveal a surprising complexity of computation at the single cell level that may be relevant for understanding optimization of signaling in neurons and neuronal networks. Computational neuroscience seeks to understand the mechanisms by which signals excite a neuron or a neuronal network. An important consideration in these studies is optimality, i.e., what signal most effectively causes excitation. Optimization of neuronal signaling is important for networks that need to minimize energy costs, for sensory neurons to selectively respond to specific stimulus features, and for therapeutic deep brain stimulators to maximize battery life. Here we show in a classic mathematical model of the action potential and in experiments on a single cell preparation that: 1) a single neuron can be highly discriminatory for the shape of low amplitude stimuli that elicit an action potential and 2) the shape of the optimal stimulus depends upon the overall state of inputs to the neuron. Our findings reveal a surprising complexity of computation at the single cell level that may be important for understanding physiological function of the nervous system.},

L5b pyramidal cells have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na+-spiking behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including Ca2+ spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats, we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing and quantified their statistics. We used these features to constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the back-propagating action potential activated Ca2+ spike firing and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes. This automated framework can be used to develop a database of faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the contribution of single-cell dynamics to network activity and its computational capabilities.

@article{Legenstein11,
	Abstract = {It has been conjectured that nonlinear processing in dendritic branches endows individual neurons with the capability to perform complex computational operations that are needed to solve for example the binding problem. However, it is not clear how single neurons could acquire such functionality in a self-organized manner, because most theoretical studies of synaptic plasticity and learning concentrate on neuron models without nonlinear dendritic properties. In the meantime, a complex picture of information processing with dendritic spikes and a variety of plasticity mechanisms in single neurons has emerged from experiments. In particular, new experimental data on dendritic branch strength potentiation in rat hippocampus have not yet been incorporated into such models. In this article, we investigate how experimentally observed plasticity mechanisms, such as depolarization-dependent spike-timing-dependent plasticity and branch-strength potentiation, could be integrated to self-organize nonlinear neural computations with dendritic spikes. We provide a mathematical proof that, in a simplified setup, these plasticity mechanisms induce a competition between dendritic branches, a novel concept in the analysis of single neuron adaptivity. We show via computer simulations that such dendritic competition enables a single neuron to become member of several neuronal ensembles and to acquire nonlinear computational capabilities, such as the capability to bind multiple input features. Hence, our results suggest that nonlinear neural computation may self-organize in single neurons through the interaction of local synaptic and dendritic plasticity mechanisms.},

Previous work on learning such models has focused on methods in which the latent features are used to determine the mean and variance of each pixel independently, or on methods in which the hidden units determine the covariance matrix of a zero-mean Gaussian distribution. In this work, we propose a probabilistic model that combines these two approaches into a single framework. We represent each image using one set of binary latent features that model the image-specific covariance and a separate set that model the mean. We show that this approach provides a probabilistic framework for the widely used simple-cell complex-cell architecture, it produces very realistic samples of natural images and it extracts features that yield state-of-the-art recognition accuracy on the challenging {CIFAR} 10 dataset.},

Specifically, we measured the {RF} properties of neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}) of macaques (Macaca mulatta) during the slow phase of optokinetic nystagmus. Using a novel method to estimate {RF} locations for both spikes and local field potentials, we found that the location on the retina that changed spike rates or local field potentials did not change with eye position; {RFs} moved with the eye. Second, we tested the hypothesis that neurons link information across eye positions by remapping the retinal location of their {RFs} to future locations. To test this, we compared {RF} locations during leftward and rightward slow phases of optokinetic nystagmus. We found no evidence for remapping during slow eye movements; the {RF} location was not affected by eye-movement direction. Together, our results show that {RFs} of {MT} neurons and the aggregate activity reflected in local field potentials are yoked to the eye during slow eye movements. This implies that individual {MT} neurons do not integrate sensory information from a single position in the world across eye movements. Future research will have to determine whether such integration, and the construction of perceptual stability, takes place in the form of a distributed population code in eye-centered visual cortex or is deferred to downstream areas.},

	Abstract = {Many neurophysiological studies in monkeys have indicated that visual motion information for the guidance of perception and smooth pursuit eye movements is - at an early stage - processed in the same visual pathway in the brain, crucially involving the middle temporal area ({MT}). However, these studies left some questions unanswered: Are perception and pursuit driven by the same or independent neuronal signals within this pathway? Are the perceptual interpretation of visual motion information and the motor response to visual signals limited by the same source of neuronal noise? Here, we review psychophysical studies that were motivated by these questions and compared perception and pursuit behaviorally in healthy human observers. We further review studies that focused on the interaction between perception and pursuit. The majority of results point to similarities between perception and pursuit, but dissociations were also reported. We discuss recent developments in this research area and conclude with suggestions for common and separate principles for the guidance of perceptual and motor responses to visual motion information.},

@book{Owen01,
	Abstract = {Empirical likelihood provides inferences whose validity does not depend on specifying a parametric model for the data. Because it uses a likelihood, the method has certain inherent advantages over resampling methods: it uses the data to determine the shape of the confidence regions, and it makes it easy to combined data from multiple sources. It also facilitates incorporating side information, and it simplifies accounting for censored, truncated, or biased sampling. One of the first books published on the subject, Empirical Likelihood offers an in-depth treatment of this method for constructing confidence regions and testing hypotheses. The author applies empirical likelihood to a range of problems, from those as simple as setting a confidence region for a univariate mean under {IID} sampling, to problems defined through smooth functions of means, regression models, generalized linear models, estimating equations, or kernel smooths, and to sampling with non-identically distributed data. Abundant figures offer visual reinforcement of the concepts and techniques. Examples from a variety of disciplines and detailed descriptions of algorithms-also posted on a companion Web site at- illustrate the methods in practice. Exercises help readers to understand and apply the methods. The method of empirical likelihood is now attracting serious attention from researchers in econometrics and biostatistics, as well as from statisticians. This book is your opportunity to explore its foundations, its advantages, and its application to a myriad of practical problems.},

@article{Deco11,
	Abstract = {A broad body of experimental work has demonstrated that apparently spontaneous brain activity is not random. At the level of large-scale neural systems, as measured with functional {MRI} ({fMRI}), this ongoing activity reflects the organization of a series of highly coherent functional networks. These so-called resting-state networks ({RSNs}) closely relate to the underlying anatomical connectivity but cannot be understood in those terms alone. Here we review three large-scale neural system models of primate neocortex that emphasize the key contributions of local dynamics, signal transmission delays and noise to the emerging {RSNs}. We propose that the formation and dissolution of resting-state patterns reflects the exploration of possible functional network configurations around a stable anatomical skeleton.},

@article{Ozeki09,
	Abstract = {In what regime does the cortical circuit operate? Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network ({ISN}), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the {ISN}.},

@article{Sasaki11,
	Abstract = {Once initiated near the soma, an action potential ({AP}) is thought to propagate autoregeneratively and distribute uniformly over axonal arbors. We challenge this classic view by showing that {APs} are subject to waveform modulation while they travel down axons. Using fluorescent patch-clamp pipettes, we recorded {APs} from axon branches of hippocampal {CA3} pyramidal neurons ex vivo. The waveforms of axonal {APs} increased in width in response to the local application of glutamate and an adenosine A1 receptor antagonist to the axon shafts, but not to other unrelated axon branches. Uncaging of calcium in periaxonal astrocytes caused {AP} broadening through ionotropic glutamate receptor activation. The broadened {APs} triggered larger calcium elevations in presynaptic boutons and facilitated synaptic transmission to postsynaptic neurons. This local {AP} modification may enable axonal computation through the geometry of axon wiring.},

	Abstract = {Several studies have shown that the information conveyed by bell-shaped tuning curves increases as their width decreases, leading to the notion that sharpening of tuning curves improves population codes. This notion, however, is based on assumptions that the noise distribution is independent among neurons and independent of the tuning curve width. Here we reexamine these assumptions in networks of spiking neurons by using orientation selectivity as an example. We compare two principal classes of model: one in which the tuning curves are sharpened through cortical lateral interactions, and one in which they are not. We report that sharpening through lateral interactions does not improve population codes but, on the contrary, leads to a severe loss of information. In addition, the sharpening models generate complicated codes that rely extensively on pairwise correlations. Our study generates several experimental predictions that can be used to distinguish between these two classes of model.},

	Abstract = {Several behavioral experiments suggest that the nervous system uses an internal model of the dynamics of the body to implement a close approximation to a Kalman filter. This filter can be used to perform a variety of tasks nearly optimally, such as predicting the sensory consequence of motor action, integrating sensory and body posture signals, and computing motor commands. We propose that the neural implementation of this Kalman filter involves recurrent basis function networks with attractor dynamics, a kind of architecture that can be readily mapped onto cortical circuits. In such networks, the tuning curves to variables such as arm velocity are remarkably noninvariant in the sense that the amplitude and width of the tuning curves of a given neuron can vary greatly depending on other variables such as the position of the arm or the reliability of the sensory feedback. This property could explain some puzzling properties of tuning curves in the motor and premotor cortex, and it leads to several new predictions.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In the vertebrate nervous system, sensory stimuli are typically encoded through the concerted activity of large populations of neurons. Classically, these patterns of activity have been treated as encoding the value of the stimulus (e.g., the orientation of a contour), and computation has been formalized in terms of function approximation. More recently, there have been several suggestions that neural computation is akin to a Bayesian inference process, with population activity patterns representing uncertainty about stimuli in the form of probability distributions (e.g., the probability density function over the orientation of a contour). This paper reviews both approaches, with a particular emphasis on the latter, which we see as a very promising framework for future modeling and experimental work.},

	Abstract = {We present a general encoding-decoding framework for interpreting the activity of a population of units. A standard population code interpretation method, the Poisson model, starts from a description as to how a single value of an underlying quantity can generate the activities of each unit in the population. In casting it in the encoding-decoding framework, we find that this model is too restrictive to describe fully the activities of units in population codes in higher processing areas, such as the medial temporal area. Under a more powerful model, the population activity can convey information not only about a single value of some quantity but also about its whole distribution, including its variance, and perhaps even the certainty the system has in the actual presence in the world of the entity generating this quantity. We propose a novel method for forming such probabilistic interpretations of population codes and compare it to the existing method.},

	Abstract = {Neurophysiologists are often faced with the problem of evaluating the quality of a code for a sensory or motor variable, either to relate it to the performance of the animal in a simple discrimination task or to compare the codes at various stages along the neuronal pathway. One common belief that has emerged from such studies is that sharpening of tuning curves improves the quality of the code, although only to a certain point; sharpening beyond that is believed to be harmful. We show that this belief relies on either problematic technical analysis or improper assumptions about the noise. We conclude that one cannot tell, in the general case, whether narrow tuning curves are better than wide ones; the answer depends critically on the covariance of the noise. The same conclusion applies to other manipulations of the tuning curve profiles such as gain increase.},

	Abstract = {It is widely believed that individual cortical neurons are unreliable encoder and that we need to consider population of cells to perform reliable computations. But it has been suggested that the observed neural correlations limit the capacity for averaging out the neural noise. Moreover, single sensory neurons have been reported with discrimination threshold close or even lower than the animal's, and many correlate strongly with the animal subjective perception or behavioral choice. We propose, on the other hand, that neural correlations and high choice probability are no hindrance but the consequence of efficient information processing in population of neurons. We have built a general model for how optimal integration could be performed in recurrent cortical networks. We propose that these networks implement an internal model of their sensory inputs and motor outputs by predicting iteratively population encoded sensory and motor variables from each other. These predictions carried in time are combined on-line with the sensory input to give the most reliable estimates of the sensory and motor states. In particular, we predict that the initially local neural information is progressively shared by all cortical neurons, leading to an increase in neural correlations and choice probability during integration. In this way, all areas participate in integration, inference and decision making. We will show that this model accounts for a wide range of neural data and makes specific testable predictions, in particular a link between the observed choice probability, neural correlations, and the requirement of the task. We will present a generalisation of this approach where cortical networks are equivalent to bayesian networks propagating estimates and certainties. Finally, we will relate the structure of cortical pathways and modularity to the type of internal statistical model they might implement.},

	Abstract = {Systems neuroscience traditionally conceptualizes a population of spiking neurons as merely encoding the value of a stimulus. Yet, psychophysics has revealed that people take into account stimulus uncertainty when performing sensory or motor computations and do so in a nearly Bayes-optimal way. This suggests that neural populations do not encode just a single value but an entire probability distribution over the stimulus. Several such probabilistic codes have been proposed, including one that utilizes the structure of neural variability to enable simple neural implementations of probabilistic computations such as optimal cue integration. This approach provides a quantitative link between Bayes-optimal behaviors and specific neural operations. It allows for novel ways to evaluate probabilistic codes and for predictions for physiological population recordings.},

	Abstract = {When making a decision, one must first accumulate evidence, often over time, and then select the appropriate action. Here, we present a neural model of decision making that can perform both evidence accumulation and action selection optimally. More specifically, we show that, given a Poisson-like distribution of spike counts, biological neural networks can accumulate evidence without loss of information through linear integration of neural activity and can select the most likely action through attractor dynamics. This holds for arbitrary correlations, any tuning curves, continuous and discrete variables, and sensory evidence whose reliability varies over time. Our model predicts that the neurons in the lateral intraparietal cortex involved in evidence accumulation encode, on every trial, a probability distribution which predicts the animal's performance. We present experimental evidence consistent with this prediction and discuss other predictions applicable to more general settings.},

                The ability to search efficiently for a target in a cluttered environment is one of the most remarkable functions of the nervous system. This task is difficult under natural circumstances, as the reliability of sensory information can vary greatly across space and time and is typically a priori unknown to the observer. In contrast, visual-search experiments commonly use stimuli of equal and known reliability. In a target detection task, we randomly assigned high or low reliability to each item on a trial-by-trial basis. An optimal observer would weight the observations by their trial-to-trial reliability and combine them using a specific nonlinear integration rule. We found that humans were near-optimal, regardless of whether distractors were homogeneous or heterogeneous and whether reliability was manipulated through contrast or shape. We present a neural-network implementation of near-optimal visual search based on probabilistic population coding. The network matched human performance.

This is accomplished by constructing a dynamical system that has solutions proportional to the probability distribution over the stimulus space, but with a constant of proportionality adjusted to provide a local estimate of the probability of the recent observations of stimulus-dependent activity-given model parameters. Next, we transform this exact equation to generate nonlinear equations for the exact evolution of log likelihood and log-likelihood ratios and show that when the input has low amplitude, linear rate models for both the likelihood and the log-likelihood functions follow naturally from these equations. We use these four explicit representations of the probability distribution to argue that, in contrast to the arguments of previous work, the dynamical system for the exact evolution of the likelihood (as opposed to the log likelihood or log-likelihood ratios) not only can be mapped onto a biologically plausible network but is also more consistent with physiological observations.},

This eye position signal is consistent with a fusimotor response (Taylor A, Durbaba R, Ellaway {PH}, Rawlinson S.

While the early phasic response can be excitatory or inhibitory, it does not accurately reflect the eye's orbital position. The late tonic response appears to carry the proprioceptive eye position signal, but it is not clear when this component emerges and whether the onset of this signal is reliable. To test the temporal dynamics of the tonic proprioceptive signal, we used an oculomotor smooth pursuit task in which saccadic eye movements and phasic proprioceptive responses are suppressed. Our results show that the tonic proprioceptive eye position signal consistently lags the actual eye position in the orbit by ∼60 ms under a variety of eye movement conditions. To confirm the proprioceptive nature of this signal, we also studied the responses of neurons in a vestibuloocular reflex ({VOR}) task in which the direction of gaze was held constant; response profiles and delay times were similar in this task, suggesting that this signal does not represent angle of gaze and does not receive visual or vestibular inputs. The length of the delay suggests that the proprioceptive eye position signal is unlikely to be used for online visual processing for action, although it could be used to calibrate an efference copy signal.},

@article{Bruno11,
	Abstract = {How neurons encode information has been a hotly debated issue. Ultimately, any code must be relevant to the senders, receivers, and connections between them. This review focuses on the transmission of sensory information through the circuit linking thalamus and cortex, two distant brain regions. Strong feedforward inhibition in the thalamocortical circuit renders cortex highly sensitive to the thalamic synchrony evoked by a sensory stimulus. Neuromodulators and feedback connections may modulate the temporal sensitivity of such circuits and gate the propagation of synchrony into other layers and cortical areas. The prevalence of strong feedforward inhibitory circuits throughout the central nervous system suggests that synchrony codes and timing-sensitive circuits may be widespread, occurring well beyond sensory thalamus and cortex. \^{a}º Strong feedforward inhibition sensitizes circuits to synchronous inputs. \^{a}º Specific stimulus features determine thalamic synchrony and thus cortical activity. \^{a}º Neuromodulators and feedback connections adjust circuit sensitivity to synchrony. \^{a}º Synchrony codes may be as prevalent in the brain as feedforward inhibitory circuits.},

@article{Geisler09,
	Abstract = {The environments in which an organism lives and the tasks it performs within those environments shape its perceptual systems through evolution and experience. This is an obvious statement, but it implies several fundamental components of research that are needed if we are going to gain a deep understanding of perceptual systems. The first is to identify the natural tasks and sub-tasks that are performed by the organism under natural conditions. The second is to measure and analyze those specific environmental properties (natural scene statistics) relevant for performing the tasks. The third is a computational analysis to determine how a rational (ideal) perceptual system would exploit the measured environmental properties to perform the tasks. This component is critical because it provides insight into the information contained in the natural stimuli and it can suggest principled hypotheses for the neural mechanisms the organism might use to exploit that information. The fourth component is to formulate specific hypotheses for neural mechanisms, based on the first three components, and test them in physiological and behavioral studies that capture the essence of the natural task. This general approach is illustrated with a study of contour grouping that combines measurements of natural scene statistics, derivation of ideal Bayesian observers that exploit those statistics, and psychophysical experiments that compare human and ideal performance. This study and other recent studies demonstrate the great potential of ``natural systems analysis'' for producing advances in behavioral science and systems neuroscience.},

@article{Shenoy11,
	Abstract = {An important aspect of cognitive flexibility is inhibitory control, the ability to dynamically modify or cancel planned actions in response to changes in the sensory environment or task demands. We formulate a probabilistic, rational decision-making framework for inhibitory control in the stop signal paradigm. Our model posits that subjects maintain a Bayes-optimal, continually updated representation of sensory inputs, and repeatedly assess the relative value of stopping and going on a fine temporal scale, in order to make an optimal decision on when and whether to go on each trial. We further posit that they implement this continual evaluation with respect to a global objective function capturing the various reward and penalties associated with different behavioral outcomes, such as speed and accuracy, or the relative costs of stop errors and go errors. We demonstrate that our rational decision-making model naturally gives rise to basic behavioral characteristics consistently observed for this paradigm, as well as more subtle effects due to contextual factors such as reward contingencies or motivational factors. Furthermore, we show that the classical race model can be seen as a computationally simpler, perhaps neurally plausible, approximation to optimal decision-making. This conceptual link allows us to predict how the parameters of the race model, such as the stopping latency, should change with task parameters and individual experiences/ability.},

In addition, many are selective for the motion of complex patterns independent of the orientation of their components, a behavior not seen in earlier visual areas. We show that the responses of {MT} cells can be captured by a linear-nonlinear model that operates not on the visual stimulus, but on the afferent responses of a population of nonlinear V1 cells. We fit this cascade model to responses of individual {MT} neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in {MT}. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

However, we also require motion processing to be very sensitive to local velocity differences, so that moving objects appear sharply distinct from their background and specific differential properties of optic flow associated with the observer's motion can be detected. Perceptual experiments give evidence both for integrative processes, which lead to spreading of perceived motion, and for differential processes, which lead to motion contrast and segmentation. Current and future experiments might allow tests of theoretical schemes that employ adaptive networks and/or multiple representations in order to reconcile the conflicting demands of integration and segmentation.},

@article{Field99,
	Abstract = {The processing of spatial information by the visual system shows a number of similarities to the wavelet transforms that have become popular in applied mathematics. Over the last decade, a range of studies have focused on the question of 'why' the visual system would evolve this strategy of coding spatial information. One such approach has focused on the relationship between the visual code and the statistics of natural scenes under the assumption that the visual system has evolved this strategy as a means of optimizing the representation of its visual environment. This paper reviews some of this literature and looks at some of the statistical properties of natural scenes that allow this code to be efficient. It is argued that such wavelet codes are efficient because they increase the independence of the vectors' outputs (i.e. they increase the independence of the responses of the visual neurons) by finding the sparse structure available in the input. Studies with neural networks that attempt to maximize the 'sparsity' of the representation have been shown to produce vectors (neural receptive fields) that have many of the properties of a wavelet representation. It is argued that the visual environment has the appropriate sparse structure to make this sparse output possible. It is argued that these sparse/independent representations make it computationally easier to detect and represent the higher--order structure present in complex environmental data.},

@article{Henriksson08,
	Abstract = {Human medial occipital cortex comprises multiple visual areas, each with a distinct retinotopic representation of visual environment. We measured spatial frequency ({SF}) tuning curves with functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) and found consistent differences between these areas. Areas V1, V2, {VP}, V3, V4v, and {V3A} were all band-pass tuned, with progressively lower {SF} optima in V1, V2, and {V3A}. In {VP} and V3, the {SF} optima were similar to optima in V2, whereas V4v showed more individual variation and scattered {SF} representations on the cortical surface. Area V5+ showed low-pass {SF} tuning. In each area, the {SF} optimum declined with increasing eccentricity. After accounting for the cortical magnification, the cortical extent of the optimal spatial wavelengths was approximately constant across eccentricity in V1, which suggests an anatomical constraint for the optimal {SF}, and this extent is actually comparable to the extent of horizontal connections within primate V1. The optimal spatial wavelengths in the visual field are also of similar extent to the spatial summation fields of macaque V1. The progressive decline in the {SF} tuning from V1 to V2 and {V3A} is compatible with the view that these areas represent visual information at different spatial scales.},

@article{Singh00,
	Abstract = {Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}) we have studied the variation in response magnitude, in each visual area ({V1-V5}), as a function of spatial frequency ({SF}), temporal frequency ({TF}) and unidirectional motion versus counterphase flicker. Each visual area was identified in each subject using a combination of retinotopic mapping {fMRI} and cortical flattening techniques. A drifting (or counterphasing) sinusoidal grating was used as the stimulus in a study in which we parametrically varied {SF} between 0.4 and 7 cycles/degree and {TF} between 0 and 18 Hz. For each experiment we constructed {fMRI} amplitude tuning curves, averaged across subjects, for each visual area. The tuning curves that resulted are consistent with the known physiological properties of cells in the corresponding macaque visual areas, previous functional imaging studies, and in the case of V1, the psychophysically determined contrast sensitivity functions for spatial and temporal frequency. In the case of {V3A}, the {SF} tuning functions obtained were more similar to those found in single cell studies of macaque V3 rather than macaque {V3A}. All areas showed at least a moderate preference for directed versus counterphasing motion with V5 showing the largest preference. Visual areas V1, V2, V3, and {V3A} showed more direction sensitivity at low spatial frequencies, while {VP}, V4, and V5 had the highest drifting versus counterphasing ratios for higher spatial frequencies.},

@article{Shmuel96,
	Abstract = {The goal of this study was to explore the functional organization of direction of motion in cat area 18. Optical imaging was used to record the activity of populations of neurons. We found a patchy distribution of cortical regions exhibiting preference for one direction over the opposite direction of motion. The degree of clustering according to preference of direction was two to four times smaller than that observed for orientation. In general, direction preference changed smoothly along the cortical surface; however, discontinuities in the direction maps were observed. These discontinuities formed lines that separated pairs of patches with preference for opposite directions. The functional maps for direction and for orientation preference were closely related; typically, an iso-orientation patch was divided into regions that exhibited preference for opposite directions, orthogonal to the orientation. In addition, the lines of discontinuity within the direction map often connected points of singularity in the orientation map. Although the organization of both domains was related, the direction and the orientation selective responses were separable; whereas the selective response according to direction of motion was nearly independent of the length of bars used for visual stimulation, the selective response to orientation decreased significantly with decreasing length of the bars. Extensive single and multiunit electrical recordings, targeted to selected domains of the functional maps, confirmed the features revealed by optical imaging. We conclude that significant processing of direction of motion is performed early in the cat visual pathway.},

Current information about the cortical layout of spatial frequency response is still incomplete because of difficulties in recording and interpreting adequate data. Here, we report results from a study of the cat primary visual cortex in which we employed a new image-analysis method that allows improved separation of signal from noise and that we used to examine the neurooptical response of the primary visual cortex to drifting sine gratings over a range of orientations and spatial frequencies. We found that (i) the optical responses to all orientations and spatial frequencies were well approximated by weighted sums of only two pairs of basis pictures, one pair for orientation and a different pair for spatial frequency; (ii) the weightings of the two pictures in each pair were approximately in quadrature (1/4 cycle apart); and (iii) our spatial frequency data revealed a cortical map that continuously assigns different optimal spatial frequency responses to different cortical locations over the entire spatial frequency range.},

@article{Rust05a,
	Abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are commonly classified as simple or complex based upon their sensitivity to the sign of stimulus contrast. The responses of both cell types can be described by a general model in which the outputs of a set of linear filters are nonlinearly combined. We estimated the model for a population of V1 neurons by analyzing the mean and covariance of the spatiotemporal distribution of random bar stimuli that were associated with spikes. This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

@article{Drewes08,
	Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that the visual system is optimized to process naturalistic inputs for both low and high level processing. Here we search for an advantageous effect of natural scene statistics when estimating speed. Ocular following responses ({OFRs}) are reflexive eye movements known to reflect many properties of low-level motion processing. Using the scleral search coil technique, we recorded human {OFRs} to drifting sinusoidal gratings ({1D}) as well as narrow bandpass noise images ({2D}).For sinusoidal gratings, it was previously shown that {OFRs} are best elicited with low spatial frequency stimuli ([[lt]]1cpd) moving at optimal speed (20--40\\\\$\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\$/s). We were able to confirm this for {2D} noise stimuli as well. However, we found a systematic difference in the acceleration profiles: {OFRs} to {2D} noise stimuli consistently showed longer latencies, yet stronger overall responses than the {1D} gratings. When combining two or more spatial frequencies, we found a gain in response strength mostly in the higher spatial frequency range. Also, we found evidence that stimuli consisting of the normalized sum of several spatial frequencies can create stronger {OFRs} than the normalized sum of the {OFRs} to the individual frequencies. When combining spatial frequencies, the weighting (mix ratio) of the individual frequencies influences the response gain. The optimum weighting with multiple bandpass noises appeared to be similar to the spectral shape of natural scenes ({1/f).These} results show a systematic difference between {OFRs} evoked by {1D} gratings and {2D} noises, and provide a first behavioral evidence that speed is best estimated by combining information across different channels, with weighting based on natural scene statistics.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a biologically motivated method of texture synthesis called reaction-diffusion and demonstrates how these textures can be generated in a manner that directly matches the geometry of a given surface. Reaction-diffusion is a process in which two or more chemicals diffuse at unequal rates over a surface and react with one another to form stable patterns such as spots and stripes. Biologists and mathematicians have explored the patterns made by several reaction-diffusion systems. We extend the range of textures that have previously been generated by using a cascade of multiple reaction-diffusion systems in which one system lays down an initial pattern and then one or more later systems refine the pattern. Examples of patterns generated by such a cascade process include the clusters of spots on leopards known as rosettes and the web-like patterns found on giraffes. In addition, this paper introduces a method which reaction-diffusion textures are created to match the geometry of an arbitrary polyhedral surface. This is accomplished by creating a mesh over a given surface and then simulating the reaction-diffusion process directly on this mesh. This avoids the often difficult task of assigning texture coordinates to a complex surface. A mesh is generated by evenly distributing points over the model using relaxation and then determining which points are adjacent by constructing their Voronoi regions. Textures are rendered directly from the mesh by using a weighted sum of mesh values to compute surface color at a given position. Such textures can also be used as bump maps.},

	Abstract = {Chemical reaction-diffusion patterns often serve as prototypes for pattern formation in living systems, but only two isothermal single-phase reaction systems have produced sustained stationary reaction-diffusion patterns so far. We designed an experimental method to search for additional systems on the basis of three steps: (i) generate spatial bistability by operating autoactivated reactions in open spatial reactors; (ii) use an independent negative-feedback species to produce spatiotemporal oscillations; and (iii) induce a space-scale separation of the activatory and inhibitory processes with a low-mobility complexing agent. We successfully applied this method to a hydrogen-ion autoactivated reaction, the thiourea-iodate-sulfite ({TuIS}) reaction, and noticeably produced stationary hexagonal arrays of spots and parallel stripes of {pH} patterns attributed to a Turing bifurcation. This method could be extended to biochemical reactions.},

@article{Howard11,
	Abstract = {Rhythmic and discrete arm movements occur ubiquitously in everyday life, and there is a debate as to whether these two classes of movements arise from the same or different underlying neural mechanisms. Here we examine interference in a motor-learning paradigm to test whether rhythmic and discrete movements employ at least partially separate neural representations. Subjects were required to make circular movements of their right hand while they were exposed to a velocity-dependent force field that perturbed the circularity of the movement path. The direction of the force-field perturbation reversed at the end of each block of 20 revolutions. When subjects made only rhythmic or only discrete circular movements, interference was observed when switching between the two opposing force fields. However, when subjects alternated between blocks of rhythmic and discrete movements, such that each was uniquely associated with one of the perturbation directions, interference was significantly reduced. Only in this case did subjects learn to corepresent the two opposing perturbations, suggesting that different neural resources were employed for the two movement types. Our results provide further evidence that rhythmic and discrete movements employ at least partially separate control mechanisms in the motor system.},

@article{Walther11,
	Abstract = {Humans are remarkably efficient at categorizing natural scenes. In fact, scene categories can be decoded from functional {MRI} ({fMRI}) data throughout the ventral visual cortex, including the primary visual cortex, the parahippocampal place area ({PPA}), and the retrosplenial cortex ({RSC}). Here we ask whether, and where, we can still decode scene category if we reduce the scenes to mere lines. We collected {fMRI} data while participants viewed photographs and line drawings of beaches, city streets, forests, highways, mountains, and offices. Despite the marked difference in scene statistics, we were able to decode scene category from {fMRI} data for line drawings just as well as from activity for color photographs, in primary visual cortex through {PPA} and {RSC}. Even more remarkably, in {PPA} and {RSC}, error patterns for decoding from line drawings were very similar to those from color photographs. These data suggest that, in these regions, the information used to distinguish scene category is similar for line drawings and photographs. To determine the relative contributions of local and global structure to the human ability to categorize scenes, we selectively removed long or short contours from the line drawings. In a category-matching task, participants performed significantly worse when long contours were removed than when short contours were removed. We conclude that global scene structure, which is preserved in line drawings, plays an integral part in representing scene categories.},

@article{Izard11,
	Abstract = {Kant argued that Euclidean geometry is synthesized on the basis of an a priori intuition of space. This proposal inspired much behavioral research probing whether spatial navigation in humans and animals conforms to the predictions of Euclidean geometry. However, Euclidean geometry also includes concepts that transcend the perceptible, such as objects that are infinitely small or infinitely large, or statements of necessity and impossibility. We tested the hypothesis that certain aspects of nonperceptible Euclidian geometry map onto intuitions of space that are present in all humans, even in the absence of formal mathematical education. Our tests probed intuitions of points, lines, and surfaces in participants from an indigene group in the Amazon, the Mundurucu, as well as adults and age-matched children controls from the United States and France and younger {US} children without education in geometry. The responses of Mundurucu adults and children converged with that of mathematically educated adults and children and revealed an intuitive understanding of essential properties of Euclidean geometry. For instance, on a surface described to them as perfectly planar, the Mundurucu's estimations of the internal angles of triangles added up to ∼180 degrees, and when asked explicitly, they stated that there exists one single parallel line to any given line through a given point. These intuitions were also partially in place in the group of younger {US} participants. We conclude that, during childhood, humans develop geometrical intuitions that spontaneously accord with the principles of Euclidean geometry, even in the absence of training in mathematics.},

	Abstract = {The reliable development of highly complex organisms is an intriguing and fascinating problem. The genetic material is, as a rule, the same in each cell of an organism. How then do cells, under the influence of their common genes, produce spatial patterns? Simple models are discussed that describe the generation of patterns out of an initially nearly homogeneous state. They are based on nonlinear interactions of at least two chemicals and on their diffusion. The concepts of local autocatalysis and of long-range inhibition play a fundamental role. Numerical simulations show that the models account for many basic biological observations such as the regeneration of a pattern after excision of tissue or the production of regular (or nearly regular) arrays of organs during (or after) completion of growth. Very complex patterns can be generated in a reproducible way by hierarchical coupling of several such elementary reactions. Applications to animal coats and to the generation of polygonally shaped patterns are provided. It is further shown how to generate a strictly periodic pattern of units that themselves exhibit a complex and polar fine structure. This is illustrated by two examples: the assembly of photoreceptor cells in the eye of Drosophila and the positioning of leaves and axillary buds in a growing shoot. In both cases, the substructures have to achieve an internal polarity under the influence of some primary pattern-forming system existing in the fly's eye or in the plant. The fact that similar models can describe essential steps in organisms as distantly related as animals and plants suggests that they reveal some universal mechanisms.},

@article{Klein00,
	Abstract = {The spectrotemporal receptive field ({STRF}) is a functional descriptor of the linear processing of time-varying acoustic spectra by the auditory system. By cross-correlating sustained neuronal activity with the dynamic spectrum of a spectrotemporally rich stimulus ensemble, one obtains an estimate of the {STRF}. In this article, the relationship between the spectrotemporal structure of any given stimulus and the quality of the {STRF} estimate is explored and exploited. Invoking the Fourier theorem, arbitrary dynamic spectra are described as sums of basic sinusoidal components---that is, moving ripples. Accurate estimation is found to be especially reliant on the prominence of components whose spectral and temporal characteristics are of relevance to the auditory locus under study and is sensitive to the phase relationships between components with identical temporal signatures. These and other observations have guided the development and use of stimuli with deterministic dynamic spectra composed of the superposition of many temporally orthogonal moving ripples having a restricted, relevant range of spectral scales and temporal rates. The method, termed sum-of-ripples, is similar in spirit to the white-noise approach butenjoys the same practical advantages---which equate to faster and moreaccurate estimation---attributable to the time-domain sum-of-sinusoidsmethod previously employed in vision research. Application of the methodis exemplified with both modeled data and experimental data from ferretprimary auditory cortex ({AI}).},

In a scheme due to Gabor, an image is represented in terms of localized symmetrical and antisymmetrical elementary signals. Both measured receptive fields and measured spatial frequency tuning curves conform closely to the functional form of Gabor elementary signals. It is argued that the visual cortex representation corresponds closely to the Gabor scheme owing to its advantages in treating the subsequent problem of pattern recognition.},

@article{Daugman80,
	Abstract = {Most vision research embracing the spatial frequency paradigm has been conceptually and mathematically a one-dimensional analysis of two-dimensional mechanisms. Spatial vision models and the experiments sustaining them have generally treated spatial frequency as a one-dimensional variable, even though receptive fields and retinal images are two-dimensional and linear transform theory obliges any frequency analysis to preserve dimension. Four models of cortical receptive fields are introduced and studied here in {2D} form, in order to illustrate the relationship between their excitatory/inhibitory spatial structure and their resulting {2D} spectral properties. It emerges that only a very special analytic class of receptive fields possess independent tuning functions for spatial frequency and orientation; namely, those profiles whose two-dimensional Fourier Transforms are expressible as the separable product of a radial function and an angular function. Furthermore, only such receptive fields would have the same orientation tuning curve for single bars as for gratings. All classes lacking this property would describe cells responsive to different orientations for different spatial frequencies and vice versa; this is shown to be the case, for example, for the Hubel \& Wiesel model of cortical orientation-tuned simple cells receiving inputs from an aligned row of center/surround {LGN} cells. When these results are considered in conjunction with psychophysical evidence for nonseparability of spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties within a '' channel'', it becomes mandatory that future spatial vision research of the Fourier genre take on an explicitly two-dimensional character.},

@article{Jones87,
	Abstract = {1. Using the two-dimensional ({2D}) spatial and spectral response profiles described in the previous two reports, we test Daugman's generalization of Marcelja's hypothesis that simple receptive fields belong to a class of linear spatial filters analogous to those described by Gabor and referred to here as {2D} Gabor filters. 2. In the space domain, we found {2D} Gabor filters that fit the {2D} spatial response profile of each simple cell in the least-squared error sense (with a simplex algorithm), and we show that the residual error is devoid of spatial structure and statistically indistinguishable from random error. 3. Although a rigorous statistical approach was not possible with our spectral data, we also found a Gabor function that fit the {2D} spectral response profile of each simple cell and observed that the residual errors are everywhere small and unstructured. 4. As an assay of spatial linearity in two dimensions, on which the applicability of Gabor theory is dependent, we compare the filter parameters estimated from the independent {2D} spatial and spectral measurements described above. Estimates of most parameters from the two domains are highly correlated, indicating that assumptions about spatial linearity are valid. 5. Finally, we show that the functional form of the {2D} Gabor filter provides a concise mathematical expression, which incorporates the important spatial characteristics of simple receptive fields demonstrated in the previous two reports. Prominent here are 1) Cartesian separable spatial response profiles, 2) spatial receptive fields with staggered subregion placement, 3) Cartesian separable spectral response profiles, 4) spectral response profiles with axes of symmetry not including the origin, and 5) the uniform distribution of spatial phase angles. 6. We conclude that the Gabor function provides a useful and reasonably accurate description of most spatial aspects of simple receptive fields. Thus it seems that an optimal strategy has evolved for sampling images simultaneously in the {2D} spatial and spatial frequency domains.},

In an examination of the reliability of spike generation using recordings from neurons in rat neocortical slices, the precision of spike timing was found to depend on stimulus transients. Constant stimuli led to imprecise spike trains, whereas stimuli with fluctuations resembling synaptic activity produced spike trains with timing reproducible to less than 1 millisecond. These data suggest a low intrinsic noise level in spike generation, which could allow cortical neurons to accurately transform synaptic input into spike sequences, supporting a possible role for spike timing in the processing of cortical information by the neocortex.},

This approach provides a clear set of guidelines for combining experimental data with other knowledge about sensory function to obtain a description that optimally predicts the way that neurons process sensory information. This prediction paradigm provides an objective method for evaluating and comparing computational models. In this chapter we review many of the system identification algorithms that have been used in sensory neurophysiology, and we show how they can be viewed as variants of a single statistical inference problem. We then review many of the practical issues that arise when applying these methods to neurophysiological experiments: stimulus selection, behavioral control, model visualization, and validation. Finally we discuss several problems to which system identification has been applied recently, including one important long-term goal of sensory neuroscience: developing models of sensory systems that accurately predict neuronal responses under completely natural conditions.},

@article{Lu01,
	Abstract = {Lu and Sperling [Vision Res. 35, 2697 (1995)] proposed that human visual motion perception is served by three separate motion systems: a first-order system that responds to moving luminance patterns, a second-order system that responds to moving modulations of feature types-stimuli in which the expected luminance is the same everywhere but an area of higher contrast or of flicker moves, and a third-order system that computes the motion of marked locations in a "salience map," that is, a neural representation of visual space in which the locations of important visual features ("figure") are marked and "ground" is unmarked. Subsequently, there have been some strongly confirmatory reports: different gain-control mechanisms for first- and second-order motion, selective impairment of first- versus second- and/or third-order motion by different brain injuries, and the classification of new third-order motions, e.g., isoluminant chromatic motion. Various procedures have successfully discriminated between second- and third-order motion (when first-order motion is excluded): dual tasks, second-order reversed phi, motion competition, and selective adaptation. Meanwhile, eight apparent contradictions to the three-systems theory have been proposed. A review and reanalysis here of the new evidence, pro and con, resolves the challenges and yields a more clearly defined and significantly strengthened theory.},

	Abstract = {The visual system evolved to process natural images, and the goal of visual neuroscience is to understand the computations it uses to do this. Indeed the goal of any theory of visual function is a model that will predict responses to any stimulus, including natural scenes. It has, however, recently become common to take this fundamental principle one step further: trying to use photographic or cinematographic representations of natural scenes (natural stimuli) as primary probes to explore visual computations. This approach is both challenging and controversial, and we argue that this use of natural images is so fraught with difficulty that it is not useful. Traditional methods for exploring visual computations that use artificial stimuli with carefully selected properties have been and continue to be the most effective tools for visual neuroscience. The proper use of natural stimuli is to test models based on responses to these synthetic stimuli, not to replace them.},

@article{Cabral11,
	Abstract = {Spatio-temporally organized low-frequency fluctuations (< 0.1 Hz), observed in {BOLD} {fMRI} signal during rest, suggest the existence of underlying network dynamics that emerge spontaneously from intrinsic brain processes. Furthermore, significant correlations between distinct anatomical regions---or functional connectivity ({FC})---have led to the identification of several widely distributed resting-state networks ({RSNs}). This slow dynamics seems to be highly structured by anatomical connectivity but the mechanism behind it and its relationship with neural activity, particularly in the gamma frequency range, remains largely unknown. Indeed, direct measurements of neuronal activity have revealed similar large-scale correlations, particularly in slow power fluctuations of local field potential gamma frequency range oscillations. To address these questions, we investigated neural dynamics in a large-scale model of the human brain's neural activity. A key ingredient of the model was a structural brain network defined by empirically derived long-range brain connectivity together with the corresponding conduction delays. A neural population, assumed to spontaneously oscillate in the gamma frequency range, was placed at each network node. When these oscillatory units are integrated in the network, they behave as weakly coupled oscillators. The time-delayed interaction between nodes is described by the Kuramoto model of phase oscillators, a biologically-based model of coupled oscillatory systems. For a realistic setting of axonal conduction speed, we show that time-delayed network interaction leads to the emergence of slow neural activity fluctuations, whose patterns correlate significantly with the empirically measured {FC}. The best agreement of the simulated {FC} with the empirically measured {FC} is found for a set of parameters where subsets of nodes tend to synchronize although the network is not globally synchronized. Inside such clusters, the simulated {BOLD} signal between nodes is found to be correlated, instantiating the empirically observed {RSNs}. Between clusters, patterns of positive and negative correlations are observed, as described in experimental studies. These results are found to be robust with respect to a biologically plausible range of model parameters. In conclusion, our model suggests how resting-state neural activity can originate from the interplay between the local neural dynamics and the large-scale structure of the brain.},

	Abstract = {A fundamental function of the visual system is to encode the building blocks of natural scenes---edges, textures and shapes---that subserve visual tasks such as object recognition and scene understanding. Essential to this process is the formation of abstract representations that generalize from specific instances of visual input. A common view holds that neurons in the early visual system signal conjunctions of image features1, 2, but how these produce invariant representations is poorly understood. Here we propose that to generalize over similar images, higher-level visual neurons encode statistical variations that characterize local image regions. We present a model in which neural activity encodes the probability distribution most consistent with a given image. Trained on natural images, the model generalizes by learning a compact set of dictionary elements for image distributions typically encountered in natural scenes. Model neurons show a diverse range of properties observed in cortical cells. These results provide a new functional explanation for nonlinear effects in complex cells3, 4, 5, 6 and offer insight into coding strategies in primary visual cortex (V1) and higher visual areas.},

However, the resulting sparse coefficients still exhibit pronounced statistical dependencies, thus violating the independence assumption of the sparse coding model. Here, we propose a model that attempts to capture the dependencies among the basis function coefficients by including a pairwise coupling term in the prior over the coefficient activity states. When adapted to the statistics of natural images, the coupling terms learn a combination of facilitatory and inhibitory interactions among neighboring basis functions. These learned interactions may offer an explanation for the function of horizontal connections in V1, and we discuss the implications of our findings for physiological experiments.},

A large class of transforms can be theoretically described by these operators, however, we propose to learn from natural movies a subset of transforms that are statistically relevant for video representation. The proposed transformation modeling is further exploited to remove inter-view redundancy, i.e., as the prediction step of video encoding. Since the Lie group transformation coefficients are continuous, a quantization step is necessary for each transform. Therefore, we derive theoretical bounds on the distortion due to coefficient quantization. The experimental results demonstrate that the new prediction method with learned transforms leads to better rate-distortion performance at higher bit-rates, and competitive performance at lower bit-rates, compared to the standard prediction based on block-based motion estimation.},

However, a simple computational framework that accounts for these empirical features of multisensory integration has not been established. We propose that divisive normalization, acting at the stage of multisensory integration, can account for many of the empirical principles of multisensory integration shown by single neurons, such as the principle of inverse effectiveness and the spatial principle. This model, which uses a simple functional operation (normalization) for which there is considerable experimental support, also accounts for the recent observation that the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs changes with cue reliability. The normalization model, which makes a strong testable prediction regarding cross-modal suppression, may therefore provide a simple unifying computational account of the important features of multisensory integration by neurons.},

To exploit modularity, it is necessary that spiking activity can propagate from one module to another while preserving the information it carries. Therefore, reliable propagation is one of the key properties of a candidate neural code. Surprisingly, the conditions under which spiking activity can be propagated have received comparatively little attention in the experimental literature. By contrast, several computational studies in the last decade have addressed this issue. Using feedforward networks ({FFNs}) as a generic network model, they have identified two dynamical activity modes that support the propagation of either asynchronous (rate code) or synchronous (temporal code) spiking. Here, we review the dichotomy of asynchronous and synchronous propagation in {FFNs}, propose their integration into a single extended conceptual framework and suggest experimental strategies to test our hypothesis.},

Specifically, it is shown that a particular implementation of the biased competition model, in which nodes compete via inhibition that targets the inputs to a cortical region, is mathematically equivalent to the linear predictive coding model. This observation demonstrates that these two important and influential rival theories of cortical function are minor variations on the same underlying mathematical model.},

	Abstract = {Past physiological and psychophysical experiments have shown that attention can modulate the effects of contextual information appearing outside the classical receptive field of a cortical neuron. Specifically, it has been suggested that attention, operating via cortical feedback connections, gates the effects of long-range horizontal connections underlying collinear facilitation in cortical area V1. This article proposes a novel mechanism, based on the computations performed within the dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells, that can account for these observations. Furthermore, it is shown that the top-down gating signal into V1 can result from a process of biased competition occurring in extrastriate cortex. A model based on these two assumptions is used to replicate the results of physiological and psychophysical experiments on collinear facilitation and attentional modulation.},

	Abstract = {The combination of two or more population-coded signals in a neural model of predictive coding can give rise to multiplicative gain modulation in the response properties of individual neurons. Synaptic weights generating these multiplicative response properties can be learned using an unsupervised, Hebbian learning rule. The behavior of the model is compared to empirical data on gaze-dependent gain modulation of cortical cells and found to be in good agreement with a range of physiological observations. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the model can learn to represent a set of basis functions. This letter thus connects an often-observed neurophysiological phenomenon and important neurocomputational principle (gain modulation) with an influential theory of brain operation (predictive coding).},

@article{Berkes09,
	Abstract = {The visual system must learn to infer the presence of objects and features in the world from the images it encounters, and as such it must, either implicitly or explicitly, model the way these elements interact to create the image. Do the response properties of cells in the mammalian visual system reflect this constraint? To address this question, we constructed a probabilistic model in which the identity and attributes of simple visual elements were represented explicitly and learnt the parameters of this model from unparsed, natural video sequences. After learning, the behaviour and grouping of variables in the probabilistic model corresponded closely to functional and anatomical properties of simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, feature identity variables were activated in a way that resembled the activity of complex cells, while feature attribute variables responded much like simple cells. Furthermore, the grouping of the attributes within the model closely parallelled the reported anatomical grouping of simple cells in cat V1. Thus, this generative model makes explicit an interpretation of complex and simple cells as elements in the segmentation of a visual scene into basic independent features, along with a parametrisation of their moment-by-moment appearances. We speculate that such a segmentation may form the initial stage of a hierarchical system that progressively separates the identity and appearance of more articulated visual elements, culminating in view-invariant object recognition. When we look at a visual scene, neurons in our eyes '' fire'' short, electrical pulses in a pattern that encodes information about the visual world. This pattern passes through a series of processing stages within the brain, eventually leading to cells whose firing encodes high-level aspects of the scene, such as the identity of a visible object regardless of its position, apparent size or angle. Remarkably, features of these firing patterns, at least at the earlier stages of the pathway, can be predicted by building '' efficient'' codes for natural images: that is, codes based on models of the statistical properties of the environment. In this study, we have taken a first step towards extending this theoretical success to describe later stages of processing, building a model that extracts a structured representation in much the same way as does the visual system. The model describes discrete, persistent visual elements, whose appearance varies over time---a simplified version of a world built of objects that move and rotate. We show that when fit to natural image sequences, features of the '' code'' implied by this model match many aspects of processing in the first cortical stage of the visual system, including: the individual firing patterns of types of cells known as '' simple'' and '' complex''; the distribution of coding properties over these cells; and even how these properties depend on the cells' physical proximity. The model thus brings us closer to understanding the functional principles behind the organisation of the visual system.},

@article{Najemnik08,
	Abstract = {Most models of visual search are based on the intuition that humans choose fixation locations containing features that best match the features of the target. The optimal version of this feature-based strategy is what we term '' maximum a posteriori ({MAP}) search.'' Alternatively, humans could choose fixations that maximize information gained about the target's location. We term this information-based strategy '' ideal search.'' Here we compare eye movements of human, {MAP}, and ideal searchers in tasks where known targets are embedded at unknown locations within random backgrounds having the spectral characteristics of natural scenes. We find that both human and ideal searchers preferentially fixate locations in a donut-shaped region around the center of the circular search area, with a high density of fixations at top and bottom, while {MAP} searchers distribute their fixations more uniformly, with low density at top and bottom. Our results argue for a sophisticated search mechanism that maximizes the information collected across fixations.},

@article{Paulin05,
	Abstract = {The cerebellum evolved in association with the electric sense and vestibular sense of the earliest vertebrates. Accurate information provided by these sensory systems would have been essential for precise control of orienting behavior in predation. A simple model shows that individual spikes in electrosensory primary afferent neurons can be interpreted as measurements of prey location. Using this result, I construct a computational neural model in which the spatial distribution of spikes in a secondary electrosensory map forms a Monte Carlo approximation to the Bayesian posterior distribution of prey locations given the sense data. The neural circuit that emerges naturally to perform this task resembles the cerebellar-like hindbrain electrosensory filtering circuitry of sharks and other electrosensory vertebrates. The optimal filtering mechanism can be extended to handle dynamical targets observed from a dynamical platform; that is, to construct an optimal dynamical state estimator using spiking neurons. This may provide a generic model of cerebellar computation. Vertebrate motion-sensing neurons have specific fractional-order dynamical characteristics that allow Bayesian state estimators to be implemented elegantly and efficiently, using simple operations with asynchronous pulses, i.e. spikes. The computational neural models described in this paper represent a novel kind of particle filter, using spikes as particles. The models are specific and make testable predictions about computational mechanisms in cerebellar circuitry, while providing a plausible explanation of cerebellar contributions to aspects of motor control, perception and cognition.},

@article{Black96,
	Abstract = {The modeling of spatial discontinuities for problems such as surface recovery, segmentation, image reconstruction, and optical flow has been intensely studied in computer vision. While line-process models of discontinuities have received a great deal of attention, there has been recent interest in the use of robust statistical techniques to account for discontinuities. This paper unifies the two approaches. To achieve this we generalize the notion of a line process to that of an analog outlier process and show how a problem formulated in terms of outlier processes can be viewed in terms of robust statistics. We also characterize a class of robust statistical problems for which an equivalent outlier-process formulation exists and give a straightforward method for converting a robust estimation problem into an outlier-process formulation. We show how prior assumptions about the spatial structure of outliers can be expressed as constraints on the recovered analog outlier processes and how traditional continuation methods can be extended to the explicit outlier-process formulation. These results indicate that the outlier-process approach provides a general framework which subsumes the traditional line-process approaches as well as a wide class of robust estimation problems. Examples in surface reconstruction, image segmentation, and optical flow are presented to illustrate the use of outlier processes and to show how the relationship between outlier processes and robust statistics can be exploited. An appendix provides a catalog of common robust error norms and their equivalent outlier-process formulations.},

@article{Friston08b,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a general model that subsumes many parametric models for continuous data. The model comprises hidden layers of state-space or dynamic causal models, arranged so that the output of one provides input to another. The ensuing hierarchy furnishes a model for many types of data, of arbitrary complexity. Special cases range from the general linear model for static data to generalised convolution models, with system noise, for nonlinear time-series analysis. Crucially, all of these models can be inverted using exactly the same scheme, namely, dynamic expectation maximization. This means that a single model and optimisation scheme can be used to invert a wide range of models. We present the model and a brief review of its inversion to disclose the relationships among, apparently, diverse generative models of empirical data. We then show that this inversion can be formulated as a simple neural network and may provide a useful metaphor for inference and learning in the brain. Models are essential to make sense of scientific data, but they may also play a central role in how we assimilate sensory information. In this paper, we introduce a general model that generates or predicts diverse sorts of data. As such, it subsumes many common models used in data analysis and statistical testing. We show that this model can be fitted to data using a single and generic procedure, which means we can place a large array of data analysis procedures within the same unifying framework. Critically, we then show that the brain has, in principle, the machinery to implement this scheme. This suggests that the brain has the capacity to analyse sensory input using the most sophisticated algorithms currently employed by scientists and possibly models that are even more elaborate. The implications of this work are that we can understand the structure and function of the brain as an inference machine. Furthermore, we can ascribe various aspects of brain anatomy and physiology to specific computational quantities, which may help understand both normal brain function and how aberrant inferences result from pathological processes associated with psychiatric disorders.},

@article{Friston10c,
	Abstract = {Chris Thornton [1] poses some simple but key questions about the free-energy principle reviewed in [2] . These puzzles have simple and clear answers: Puzzle: '' A generative model of causal structure in the environment is [then] obtained, on which basis the agent is able to infer the 'causes of sensory samples' [ibid. p. 294]. What is unclear is how this mechanism would function where sensory samples are ambiguous'' [1] . Answer: One of the main motivations for the free-energy principle is its appeal to [approximate] Bayesian inference where ambiguities are resolved by priors [3] . Priors are mandated by the (ill-posed) problems created by ambiguity and empirical priors are an integral part of hierarchical inference [{2,Box} 3]. This is not theoretical hand waving; in biophysics, the free-energy formulation is used routinely to solve difficult ill-posed inverse problems (e.g. [4] ). Puzzle: '' On the face of it, no particular stand is taken on emergence of the structures that mediate minimization. But looking at the definition of free-energy, we find a significant role being played by the variable . It is values of this variable that encapsulate the brain's representation of 'environmental causes''' [1] . Answer: The representations are not environmental causes but the sufficient statistics μ of the brain's recognition density q ( ; μ ); these include synaptic activity and efficacy [2] . The implicit optimization of neuronal connections (i.e. perceptual learning) leads to hierarchical brain structures (models) that recapitulate causal structure in the sensorium. This optimization process can 'prune' the form or structure of the model (cf., synaptic pruning [5] ) and is used routinely in model optimization (e.g. automatic relevance determination [6] ). Furthermore, one could regard natural selection as optimizing the structural form of models at an evolutionary scale, through minimizing free-energy (where it is called free-fitness [7] ). In a statistical setting, free-energy bounds on model evidence are used routinely in Bayesian model selection (where the log model evidence is negative surprise, e.g. [8] ;) ( Figure 1 ).},

@article{Friston11a,
	Abstract = {This note describes a Bayesian model selection or optimization procedure for post hoc inferences about reduced versions of a full model. The scheme provides the evidence (marginal likelihood) for any reduced model as a function of the posterior density over the parameters of the full model. It rests upon specifying models through priors on their parameters, under the assumption that the likelihood remains the same for all models considered. This provides a quick and efficient scheme for scoring arbitrarily large numbers of models, after inverting a single (full) model. In turn, this enables the selection among discrete models that are distinguished by the presence or absence of free parameters, where free parameters are effectively removed from the model using very precise shrinkage priors. An alternative application of this post hoc model selection considers continuous model spaces, defined in terms of hyperparameters (sufficient statistics) of the prior density over model parameters. In this instance, the prior (model) can be optimized with respect to its evidence. The expressions for model evidence become remarkably simple under the Laplace (Gaussian) approximation to the posterior density. Special cases of this scheme include {Savage--Dickey} density ratio tests for reduced models and automatic relevance determination in model optimization. We illustrate the approach using general linear models and a more complicated nonlinear state-space model.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic causal modelling ({DCM}) is a method for estimating and making inferences about the coupling among small numbers of brain areas, and the influence of experimental manipulations on that coupling [Friston, {K.J}., Harrison, L., Penny, W., 2003 Dynamic causal modelling. Neuroimage 19, 1273-1302]. Large-scale neural modelling aims to construct neurobiologically grounded computational models with emergent behaviours that inform our understanding of neuronal systems. One such model has been used to simulate region-specific {BOLD} time-series [Horwitz, B., Friston, {K.J}., Taylor, {J.G}., 2000. Neural modeling and functional brain imaging: an overview. Neural Netw. 13, 829-846]. {DCM} was used to make inferences about effective connectivity using data generated by a model implementing a visual delayed match-to-sample task [Tagamets, {M.A}., Horwitz, B., 1998. Integrating electrophysiological and anatomical experimental data to create a large-scale model that simulates a delayed match-to-sample human brain imaging study. Cereb. Cortex 8, 310-320]. The aim was to explore the validity of inferences made using {DCM} about the connectivity structure and task-dependent modulatory effects, in a system with a known connectivity structure. We also examined the effects of misspecifying regions of interest. Models with hierarchical connectivity and reciprocal connections were examined using {DCM} and Bayesian Model Comparison [Penny, {W.D}., Stephan, {K.E}., Mechelli, A., Friston, {K.J}., 2004. Comparing dynamic causal models. Neuroimage 22, 1157-1172]. This approach revealed strong evidence for those models with correctly specified anatomical connectivity. Furthermore, Bayesian model comparison favoured those models when bilinear effects corresponded to their implementation in the neural model. These findings generalised to an extended model with two additional areas and reentrant circuits. The conditional uncertainty of coupling parameter estimates increased in proportion to the number of incorrectly specified regions. These results highlight the role of neural models in establishing the validity of estimation and inference schemes. Specifically, Bayesian model comparison confirms the validity of {DCM} in relation to a well-characterised and comprehensive neuronal model.},

@article{Roach11,
	Abstract = {Cortical motion analysis continuously encodes image velocity but might also be used to predict future patterns of sensory input along the motion path. We asked whether this predictive aspect of motion is exploited by the human visual system. Targets can be more easily detected at the leading as compared to the trailing edge of motion [1], but this effect has been attributed to a nonspecific boost in contrast gain at the leading edge, linked to motion-induced shifts in spatial position [1, 2, 3 and 4]. Here we show that the detectability of a local sinusoidal target presented at the ends of a region containing motion is phase dependent at the leading edge, but not at the trailing edge. These two observations rule out a simple gain control mechanism that modulates contrast energy and passive filtering explanations, respectively. By manipulating the relative orientation of the moving pattern and target, we demonstrate that the resulting spatial variation in detection threshold along the edge closely resembles the superposition of sensory input and an internally generated predicted signal. These findings show that motion induces a forward prediction of spatial pattern that combines with the cortical representation of the future stimulus. \^{a}º The human visual system uses motion information to construct a forward model \^{a}º Sensory thresholds depend on superposition of internal prediction and sensory input \^{a}º Constructive interference improves detectability of stimuli matching prediction \^{a}º Destructive interference reduces detectability of stimuli inconsistent with prediction},

Both patients were selectively impaired on direction discrimination in several local and global second-order but not first-order motion tasks. However, only patient {FD} was impaired on a specific bi-stable motion task where the direction of motion is biased by object similarity. We suggest that this bi-stable motion task may be mediated by a high-level attention or position based mechanism indicating a separate neurological substrate for a high-level attention or position-based mechanism. Therefore, these results provide evidence for the existence of at least three motion mechanisms in the human visual system: a low-level first- and second-order motion mechanism and a high-level attention or position-based mechanism.},

Recent behavioral experiments show evidence for the integration of pre- and postsaccadic information (even subliminally), the modulation of visual sensitivity, and the rapid reallocation of attention. The recent physiological literature has identified a characteristic modulation of neural responsiveness-perisaccadic reduction followed by a postsaccadic increase-that is found in many visual areas, but whose source is as yet unknown. This modulation seems optimal for reducing sensitivity during and boosting sensitivity between saccades, but no study has yet established a direct causal link between neural and behavioral changes.},

	Abstract = {Single neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) show variability in spike activity in response to an identical visual stimulus. In the current study, we examined the behavioral significance of the variability in spike activity of V1 neurons for visually guided saccades. We recorded single-cell activity from V1 of monkeys trained to detect and make saccades toward visual targets of varying contrast and analyzed trial-to-trial covariation between the onset time or firing rate of neural response and saccadic response time ({RT}). Neural latency ({NL}, the time of the first spike of neural response) was correlated with {RT}, whereas firing rate ({FR}) was not. When {FR} was computed with respect to target onset ignoring {NL}, a '' false'' correlation between {FR} and {RT} emerged. Multiple regression and partial correlation analyses on {NL} and {FR} for predictability of {RT} variability, as well as a simulation with artificial Poisson spike trains, supported the conclusion that the correlation between {FR} with respect to target onset and {RT} was mediated by a correlation between {NL} and {RT}, emphasizing the role of trial-to-trial variability of {NL} for extracting {RT}-related signals. We attempted to examine laminar differences in {RT}-related activity. Neurons recorded in the superficial layers tended to show a higher sensitivity to stimulus contrast and a lower correlation with {RT} compared with those in the lower layers, suggesting a sensory-to-motor transformation within V1 that follows the order of known anatomical connections. These results demonstrate that the trial-to-trial variability of neural response in V1 propagates to the stage of saccade execution, resulting in trial-to-trial variability of {RT} of a visually guided saccade.},

@article{Shoemaker11,
	Abstract = {We generated panoramic imagery by simulating a fly-like robot carrying an imaging sensor, moving in free flight through a virtual arena bounded by walls, and containing obstructions. Flight was conducted under closed-loop control by a bio-inspired algorithm for visual guidance with feedback signals corresponding to the true optic flow that would be induced on an imager (computed by known kinematics and position of the robot relative to the environment). The robot had dynamics representative of a housefly-sized organism, although simplified to two-degree-of-freedom flight to generate uniaxial (azimuthal) optic flow on the retina in the plane of travel. Surfaces in the environment contained images of natural and man-made scenes that were captured by the moving sensor. Two bio-inspired motion detection algorithms and two computational optic flow estimation algorithms were applied to sequences of image data, and their performance as optic flow estimators was evaluated by estimating the mutual information between outputs and true optic flow in an equatorial section of the visual field. Mutual information for individual estimators at particular locations within the visual field was surprisingly low (less than 1 bit in all cases) and considerably poorer for the bio-inspired algorithms that the man-made computational algorithms. However, mutual information between weighted sums of these signals and comparable sums of the true optic flow showed significant increases for the bio-inspired algorithms, whereas such improvement did not occur for the computational algorithms. Such summation is representative of the spatial integration performed by wide-field motion-sensitive neurons in the third optic ganglia of flies.},

	Abstract = {Rats discriminate objects by scanning their surface with the facial vibrissae, producing spatiotemporally complex sequences of tactile contacts. The way in which the somatosensory cortex responds to these complex multivibrissal stimuli has not been explored. It is unclear yet whether contextual information from across the entire whisker pad influences cortical responses. Here, we delivered tactile stimuli to the rat vibrissae using a new 24 whisker stimulator. We tested sequences of rostrocaudal whisker deflections that generate multivibrissal motion patterns in different directions across the mystacial pad, allowing to disambiguate local from global sensory integration. Unitary electrophysiological recordings from different layers of the barrel cortex showed that a majority of neurons has direction selectivity for the multivibrissal stimulus. The selectivity resulted from nonlinear integration of responses across the mystacial pad. Our results indicate that the system extracts collective properties of a tactile scene.},

@article{Meso09,
	Abstract = {For animals to carry out a wide range of detection, recognition and navigation tasks, visual motion signals are crucial. The encoding of motion information has therefore, attracted much attention in the experimental and computational study of brain function. Two main alternative mechanisms have been proposed on the basis of behavioural and physiological experiments. On one hand, correlation-type and motion energy detectors are simple and efficient in the design of their basic mechanism but are tuned to temporal frequency rather than to speed. On other hand, gradient-type motion detectors directly represent an estimate of speed, but may require more demanding processing mechanisms. We demonstrate here how the temporal frequency dependence observed for sine-wave gratings can disappear for less constrained stimuli, to be replaced by responses reflecting speed for stimuli like square waves when a phase-sensitive detection mechanism is employed. We conclude from these observations that temporal frequency tuning is not necessarily a limitation for motion vision based on correlation detectors, and more generally demonstrate in view of the typical Fourier composition of natural scenes, that correlation detectors operating in such environments can encode image speed. In the context of our results, we discuss the implications of the loss of phase sensitivity inherent in using a linear system approach to describe neural processing.},

An optimum sensitivity ratio of the carrier to the modulator frequency of about 11 was measured. Tuning for speed was also observed, with sensitivity falling off at higher speeds in a trend showing scale invariance, consistent with temporal frequency tuning. Similar tuning properties were observed for both luminance and motion contrast thresholds. These findings are consistent with local and global processes in striate and extra-striate cortex respectively and suggest the scale of second stage low frequency integration is broad and matched to the spatiotemporal scale of the sensitivity of first stage local filters. The finding of scale invariance over a large range in stimulus size of 4.6--37\\$\\\\,^{\\\\circ}\\$ of visual angle suggest a general property of integrating neural mechanisms, which was identified here because of the use of narrowband stimuli.},

	Abstract = {Neural field models of firing rate activity typically take the form of integral equations with space-dependent axonal delays. Under natural assumptions on the synaptic connectivity we show how one can derive an equivalent partial differential equation ({PDE}) model that properly treats the axonal delay terms of the integral formulation. Our analysis avoids the so-called long-wavelength approximation that has previously been used to formulate {PDE} models for neural activity in two spatial dimensions. Direct numerical simulations of this {PDE} model show instabilities of the homogeneous steady state that are in full agreement with a Turing instability analysis of the original integral model. We discuss the benefits of such a local model and its usefulness in modeling electrocortical activity. In particular, we are able to treat '' patchy'' connections, whereby a homogeneous and isotropic system is modulated in a spatially periodic fashion. In this case the emergence of a '' lattice-directed'' traveling wave predicted by a linear instability analysis is confirmed by the numerical simulation of an appropriate set of coupled {PDEs}.},

	Abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging ({fMRI}), electroencephalogram ({EEG}), and magnetoencephalogram ({MEG}). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

	Abstract = {We reconstruct the entire experimentally observed spatio-temporal signal of a human magnetoencephalogram ({MEG}) observed in a sensori-motor-coordination experiment by Kelso et al. In this experiment, when an acoustic stimulus frequency is changed systematically, a spontaneous transition in coordination occurs at a critical frequency in both the motor behavior and brain signals. Here we present a stepwise approach for the reconstruction of the spatio-temporal signal: First, we identify the order parameters and recall a theoretical model by the present authors and Kelso which reproduces the temporal dynamics of the order parameters. Second, we use the variational method by Uhl et al. in order to determine the spatial modes of the order parameters. Third, we present a variational method for the reconstruction of the remaining spatio-temporal signal and determine the spatial modes and temporal dynamics of the enslaved variables and possible order parameter modifications. The obtained set of spatial modes proves to be a fixed spatial base system of the observed temporal dynamics in the brain.},

@article{Jirsa97,
	Abstract = {The purpose of this paper is twofold: First, we present a semi-quantitative nonlinear field theory of the brain under realistic anatomical connectivity conditions describing the interaction between functional units within the brain. This macroscopic field theory is derived from the quasi-microscopic conversion properties of neural populations occurring at synapses and somas. The quasi-microscopic models by {Wilson-Cowan} (1972,1973) and Nunez (1974) can be derived from these. Functional units are treated as inhomogeneities within a nonlinear one-dimensional neural tissue. Second, for the case of the Kelso experiment the field equation is treated analytically and numerically and can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations which corresponds to a model by Jirsa et al. (1994, 1995). This phenomenological model reproduces the spatio-temporal phenomena experimentally observed. Here the most prominent property of the neural tissue is the parametric excitation. The macroscopic field parameters can be expressed by quasi-microscopic neural parameters.},

	Abstract = {Spatially continuous networks with heterogeneous connections are ubiquitous in biological systems, in particular neural systems. To understand the mutual effects of locally homogeneous and globally heterogeneous connectivity, we investigate the stability of the rest-state activity of a neural field as a function of its connectivity. The variation of the connectivity is operationalized through manipulation of a heterogeneous two-point connection embedded into the otherwise homogeneous connectivity matrix, as well as by variation of connectivity strength and a finite transmission speed. The latter results in a time delay of communication among individual brain areas. We demonstrate that the local connectivity generates the well-known power-law behaviour of the electroencephalographic power spectrum with an exponent close to −2, whereas the global connections generate a more characteristic line spectrum. These spectral characteristics are routinely observed in large-scale topographies of the human brain.},

@article{Pinotsis11,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a neural field model for local (mesoscopic) dynamics on the cortical surface. Our focus is on sparse intrinsic connections that are characteristic of real cortical microcircuits. This sparsity is modelled with radial connectivity functions or kernels with non-central peaks. The ensuing analysis allows one to generate or predict spectral responses to known exogenous input or random fluctuations. Here, we characterise the effect of different connectivity architectures (the range, dispersion and propagation speed of intrinsic or lateral connections) and synaptic gains on spatiotemporal dynamics. Specifically, we look at spectral responses to random fluctuations and examine the ability of synaptic gain and connectivity parameters to induce Turing instabilities. We find that although the spatial deployment and speed of lateral connections can have a profound affect on the behaviour of spatial modes over different scales, only synaptic gain is capable of producing phase-transitions. We discuss the implications of these findings for the use of neural fields as generative models in dynamic causal modeling ({DCM}).},

	Abstract = {Both ongoing and natural stimulus driven neuronal activity are dominated by transients. Selective gating of these transients is mandatory for proper brain function and may, in fact, form the basis of millisecond-fast decision making and action selection. Here we propose that neuronal networks may exploit timing differences between correlated excitation and inhibition (temporal gating) to control the propagation of spiking activity transients. When combined with excitation--inhibition balance, temporal gating constitutes a powerful mechanism to control the propagation of mixtures of transient and tonic neural activity components.},

More specifically, we aim at the establishment of this neuromorphic system as a flexible and neuroscientifically valuable modeling tool that can be used by non-hardware experts. We consider various functional aspects to be crucial for this purpose, and we introduce a consistent workflow with detailed descriptions of all involved modules that implement the suggested steps: The integration of the hardware interface into the simulator-independent model description language {PyNN}; a fully automated translation between the {PyNN} domain and appropriate hardware configurations; an executable specification of the future neuromorphic system that can be seamlessly integrated into this biology-to-hardware mapping process as a test bench for all software layers and possible hardware design modifications; an evaluation scheme that deploys models from a dedicated benchmark library, compares the results generated by virtual or prototype hardware devices with reference software simulations and analyzes the differences. The integration of these components into one hardware--software workflow provides an ecosystem for ongoing preparative studies that support the hardware design process and represents the basis for the maturity of the model-to-hardware mapping software.

@article{Zhaoping11,
	Abstract = {We show that human ability to discriminate the wavelength of monochromatic light can be understood as maximum likelihood decoding of the cone absorptions, with a signal processing efficiency that is independent of the wavelength. This work is built on the framework of ideal observer analysis of visual discrimination used in many previous works. A distinctive aspect of our work is that we highlight a perceptual confound that observers should confuse a change in input light wavelength with a change in input intensity. Hence a simple ideal observer model which assumes that an observer has a full knowledge of input intensity should over-estimate human ability in discriminating wavelengths of two inputs of unequal intensity. This confound also makes it difficult to consistently measure human ability in wavelength discrimination by asking observers to distinguish two input colors while matching their brightness. We argue that the best experimental method for reliable measurement of discrimination thresholds is the one of Pokorny and Smith, in which observers only need to distinguish two inputs, regardless of whether they differ in hue or brightness. We mathematically formulate wavelength discrimination under this wavelength-intensity confound and show a good agreement between our theoretical prediction and the behavioral data. Our analysis explains why the discrimination threshold varies with the input wavelength, and shows how sensitively the threshold depends on the relative densities of the three types of cones in the retina (and in particular predict discriminations in dichromats). Our mathematical formulation and solution can be applied to general problems of sensory discrimination when there is a perceptual confound from other sensory feature dimensions.},

	Abstract = {Intrinsic-signal optical imaging was used to evaluate relationships of domains of neurons in middle temporal visual area ({MT}) selective for stimulus orientation and direction-of-motion. Maps of activation were elicited in {MT} of owl monkeys by gratings drifting back-and-forth, flashed stationary gratings and unidirectionally drifting fields of random dots. Drifting gratings, typically used to reveal orientation preference domains, contain a motion component that may be represented in {MT}. Consequently, this stimulus could activate groups of cells responsive to the motion of the grating, its orientation or a combination of both. Domains elicited from either moving or static gratings were remarkably similar, indicating that these groups of cells are responding to orientation, although they may also encode information about motion. To assess the relationship between domains defined by drifting oriented gratings and those responsive to direction-of-motion, the response to drifting fields of random dots was measured within domains defined from thresholded maps of activation elicited by the drifting gratings. The optical response elicited by drifting fields of random dots was maximal in a direction orthogonal to the map of orientation preference. Thus, neurons in domains selective for stimulus orientation are also selective for motion orthogonal to the preferred stimulus orientation.},

@article{Diogo03,
	Abstract = {We studied the spatial organization of directionally selective neurons in the cortical middle temporal visual area (area {MT}) of the Cebus monkey. We recorded neuronal activity from multielectrode arrays as they were stepped through area {MT}. The set of recording sites in each array penetration described a plane parallel to the cortical layers. At each recording site, we determined the preferred direction of motion. Responses recorded at successive locations from the same electrode in the array revealed gradual changes in preferred direction, along with occasional directional reversals. Comparisons of responses from adjacent electrodes at successive locations enabled electrophysiological imaging of the two-dimensional pattern of preferred directions across the cortex. Our results demonstrate a systematic organization for directionality in area {MT} of the New World Cebus monkey, which is similar to that known to exist in the Old World macaque. In addition, our results provide electrophysiological confirmation of map features that have been documented in other cortical areas and primate species by optical imaging. Specifically, the tangential organization of directional selectivity is characterized by slow continuous changes in directional preference, as well as lines (fractures) and points (singularities) that fragment continuous regions into patches. These electrophysiological methods also allowed a direct investigation of neuronal selectivities that give rise to map features. In particular, our results suggest that inhibitory mechanisms may be involved in the generation of fractures and singularities.},

Such visualization tool proves useful in machine learning whenever learning/adaptation algorithms insist on high-dimensional Riemannian parameter manifolds. In particular, the manuscript describes the cases of interest in the recent scientific literature that the parameter space is the set of special orthogonal matrices, the unit hypersphere and the manifold of symmetric positive-definite matrices. The paper also recalls the notion of multidimensional scaling and discusses its algorithmic implementation. Some numerical experiments performed on toy problems help the readers to get acquainted with the problem at hand, while experiments performed on independent component analysis data as well as averaging data show the usefulness of the proposed visualization tool.},

	Abstract = {Many organisms can predict future events from the statistics of past experience, but humans also excel at making predictions by pure reasoning: integrating multiple sources of information, guided by abstract knowledge, to form rational expectations about novel situations, never directly experienced. Here, we show that this reasoning is surprisingly rich, powerful, and coherent even in preverbal infants. When 12-month-old infants view complex displays of multiple moving objects, they form time-varying expectations about future events that are a systematic and rational function of several stimulus variables. Infants' looking times are consistent with a Bayesian ideal observer embodying abstract principles of object motion. The model explains infants' statistical expectations and classic qualitative findings about object cognition in younger babies, not originally viewed as probabilistic inferences.},

@article{London10,
	Abstract = {It is well known that neural activity exhibits variability, in the sense that identical sensory stimuli produce different responses1, 2, 3, but it has been difficult to determine what this variability means. Is it noise, or does it carry important information---about, for example, the internal state of the organism? Here we address this issue from the bottom up, by asking whether small perturbations to activity in cortical networks are amplified. Based on in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat barrel cortex, we find that a perturbation consisting of a single extra spike in one neuron produces approximately 28 additional spikes in its postsynaptic targets. We also show, using simultaneous intra- and extracellular recordings, that a single spike in a neuron produces a detectable increase in firing rate in the local network. Theoretical analysis indicates that this amplification leads to intrinsic, stimulus-independent variations in membrane potential of the order of \\$\\\\pm\\$2.2--4.5 {mV}---variations that are pure noise, and so carry no information at all. Therefore, for the brain to perform reliable computations, it must either use a rate code, or generate very large, fast depolarizing events, such as those proposed by the theory of synfire chains4, 5. However, in our in vivo recordings, we found that such events were very rare. Our findings are thus consistent with the idea that cortex is likely to use primarily a rate code.},

@article{Pernice11,
	Abstract = {Networks are becoming a ubiquitous metaphor for the understanding of complex biological systems, spanning the range between molecular signalling pathways, neural networks in the brain, and interacting species in a food web. In many models, we face an intricate interplay between the topology of the network and the dynamics of the system, which is generally very hard to disentangle. A dynamical feature that has been subject of intense research in various fields are correlations between the noisy activity of nodes in a network. We consider a class of systems, where discrete signals are sent along the links of the network. Such systems are of particular relevance in neuroscience, because they provide models for networks of neurons that use action potentials for communication. We study correlations in dynamic networks with arbitrary topology, assuming linear pulse coupling. With our novel approach, we are able to understand in detail how specific structural motifs affect pairwise correlations. Based on a power series decomposition of the covariance matrix, we describe the conditions under which very indirect interactions will have a pronounced effect on correlations and population dynamics. In random networks, we find that indirect interactions may lead to a broad distribution of activation levels with low average but highly variable correlations. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in networks with distance dependent connectivity. In contrast, networks with highly connected hubs or patchy connections often exhibit strong average correlations. Our results are particularly relevant in view of new experimental techniques that enable the parallel recording of spiking activity from a large number of neurons, an appropriate interpretation of which is hampered by the currently limited understanding of structure-dynamics relations in complex networks. Many biological systems have been described as networks whose complex properties influence the behaviour of the system. Correlations of activity in such networks are of interest in a variety of fields, from gene-regulatory networks to neuroscience. Due to novel experimental techniques allowing the recording of the activity of many pairs of neurons and their importance with respect to the functional interpretation of spike data, spike train correlations in neural networks have recently attracted a considerable amount of attention. Although origin and function of these correlations is not known in detail, they are believed to have a fundamental influence on information processing and learning. We present a detailed explanation of how recurrent connectivity induces correlations in local neural networks and how structural features affect their size and distribution. We examine under which conditions network characteristics like distance dependent connectivity, hubs or patches markedly influence correlations and population signals.},

	Abstract = {Many cells in retinotopic brain areas increase their activity when saccades (rapid eye movements) are about to bring stimuli into their receptive fields. Although previous work has attempted to look at the functional correlates of such predictive remapping, no study has explicitly tested for better attentional performance at the future retinal locations of attended targets. We found that, briefly before the eyes start moving, attention drawn to the targets of upcoming saccades also shifted to those retinal locations that the targets would cover once the eyes had moved, facilitating future movements. This suggests that presaccadic visual attention shifts serve to both improve presaccadic perceptual processing at the target locations and speed subsequent eye movements to their new postsaccadic locations. Predictive remapping of attention provides a sparse, efficient mechanism for keeping track of relevant parts of the scene when frequent rapid eye movements provoke retinal smear and temporal masking.},

@article{Montagnini07,
	Abstract = {The quality of the representation of an object's motion is limited by the noise in the sensory input as well as by an intrinsic ambiguity due to the spatial limi- tation of the visual motion analyzers (aperture prob- lem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that motion processing of extended ob jects is initially dominated by the local {1D} motion cues orthogonal to the ob ject's edges, whereas {2D} information takes pro- gressively over and leads to the final correct represen- tation of global motion. A Bayesian framework ac- counting for the sensory noise and general expectancies for ob ject velocities has proven successful in explaining several experimental findings concerning early motion processing [1, 2, 3]. However, a complete functional model, encompassing the dynamical evolution of ob- ject motion perception is still lacking. Here we outline several experimental observations concerning human smooth pursuit of moving ob jects and more particu- larly the time course of its initiation phase. In addi- tion, we propose a recursive extension of the Bayesian model, motivated and constrained by our oculomotor data, to describe the dynamical integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information.},

@article{Kremkow10,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the neocortex receive a large number of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. Excitation and inhibition dynamically balance each other, with inhibition lagging excitation by only few milliseconds. To characterize the functional consequences of such correlated excitation and inhibition, we studied models in which this correlation structure is induced by feedforward inhibition ({FFI}). Simple circuits show that an effective {FFI} changes the integrative behavior of neurons such that only synchronous inputs can elicit spikes, causing the responses to be sparse and precise. Further, effective {FFI} increases the selectivity for propagation of synchrony through a feedforward network, thereby increasing the stability to background activity. Last, we show that recurrent random networks with effective inhibition are more likely to exhibit dynamical network activity states as have been observed in vivo. Thus, when a feedforward signal path is embedded in such recurrent network, the stabilizing effect of effective inhibition creates an suitable substrate for signal propagation. In conclusion, correlated excitation and inhibition support the notion that synchronous spiking may be important for cortical processing.},

	Abstract = {We study cortical network dynamics for a spatially embedded network model. It represents, in terms of spatial scale, a large piece of cortex allowing for long-range connections, resulting in a rather sparse connectivity. The spatial embedding also permits us to include distance-dependent conduction delays. We use two different types of conductance-based {I\&F} neurons as excitatory and inhibitory units, as well as specific connection probabilities. In order to remain computationally tractable, we reduce neuron density, modelling part of the missing internal input via external poissonian spike trains. Compared to previous studies, we observe significant changes in the dynamical phase space: Altered activity patterns require another regularity measures than the coefficient of variation. Hence, we compare three different regularity measure on the basis of artificial inter-spike-interval distributions. We identify two types of mixed states, where different phases coexist in certain regions of the phase space. More notably, our boundary between high and low activity states depends predominantly on the relation between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic strength instead of the input rate.},

	Abstract = {The machinery behind the visual perception of motion and the subsequent sensori-motor transformation, such as in ocular following response ({OFR}), is confronted to uncertainties which are efficiently resolved in the primate's visual system. We may understand this response as an ideal observer in a probabilistic framework by using Bayesian theory [Weiss, Y., Simoncelli, {E.P}., Adelson, {E.H}., 2002. Motion illusions as optimal percepts. Nature Neuroscience, 5(6), 598-604, doi:10.1038/nn858] which we previously proved to be successfully adapted to model the {OFR} for different levels of noise with full field gratings. More recent experiments of {OFR} have used disk gratings and bipartite stimuli which are optimized to study the dynamics of center-surround integration. We quantified two main characteristics of the spatial integration of motion: (i) a finite optimal stimulus size for driving {OFR}, surrounded by an antagonistic modulation and (ii) a direction selective suppressive effect of the surround on the contrast gain control of the central stimuli [Barth\'{e}lemy, {F.V}., Vanzetta, I., Masson, {G.S}., 2006. Behavioral receptive field for ocular following in humans: dynamics of spatial summation and center-surround interactions. Journal of Neurophysiology, (95), 3712-3726, doi:10.1152/jn.00112.2006]. Herein, we extended the ideal observer model to simulate the spatial integration of the different local motion cues within a probabilistic representation. We present analytical results which show that the hypothesis of independence of local measures can describe the spatial integration of the motion signal. Within this framework, we successfully accounted for the contrast gain control mechanisms observed in the behavioral data for center-surround stimuli. However, another inhibitory mechanism had to be added to account for suppressive effects of the surround.},

@article{Barthelemy08a,
	Abstract = {Integrating information is essential to measure the physical {2D} motion of a surface from both ambiguous local {1D} motion of its elongated edges and non-ambiguous {2D} motion of its features such as corners or texture elements. The dynamics of this motion integration shows a complex time course as read from tracking eye movements: first, local {1D} motion signals are extracted and pooled to initiate ocular responses, then {2D} motion signals are integrated to adjust the tracking direction until it matches the surface motion direction. The nature of these {1D} and {2D} motion computations are still unclear. One hypothesis is that their different dynamics may be explained from different contrast sensitivities. To test this, we measured contrast-response functions of early, {1D}-driven and late, {2D}-driven components of ocular following responses to different motion stimuli: gratings, plaids and barberpoles. We found that contrast dynamics of {1D}-driven responses are nearly identical across the different stimuli. On the contrary, late {2D}-driven components with either plaids or barberpoles have similar latencies but different contrast dynamics. Temporal dynamics of both {1D}- and {2D}-driven responses demonstrates that the different contrast gains are set very early during the response time course. Running a Bayesian model of motion integration, we show that a large family of contrast-response functions can be predicted from the probability distributions of {1D} and {2D} motion signals for each stimulus and by the shape of the prior distribution. However, the pure delay (i.e. largely independent upon contrast) observed between {1D}- and {2D}-motion supports the fact that {1D} and {2D} probability distributions are computed independently. This two-pathway Bayesian model supports the idea that {1D} and {2D} mechanisms represent edges and features motion in parallel.},

@article{Bogadhi11,
	Abstract = {Accuracy in estimating an object's global motion over time is not only affected by the noise in visual motion information but also by the spatial limitation of the local motion analyzers (aperture problem). Perceptual and oculomotor data demonstrate that during the initial stages of the motion information processing, {1D} motion cues related to the object's edges have a dominating influence over the estimate of the object's global motion. However, during the later stages, {2D} motion cues related to terminators (edge-endings) progressively take over, leading to a final correct estimate of the object's global motion. Here, we propose a recursive extension to the Bayesian framework for motion processing (Weiss, Simoncelli, \& Adelson, 2002) cascaded with a model oculomotor plant to describe the dynamic integration of {1D} and {2D} motion information in the context of smooth pursuit eye movements. In the recurrent Bayesian framework, the prior defined in the velocity space is combined with the two independent measurement likelihood functions, representing edge-related and terminator-related information, respectively to obtain the posterior. The prior is updated with the posterior at the end of each iteration step. The maximum-a posteriori ({MAP}) of the posterior distribution at every time step is fed into the oculomotor plant to produce eye velocity responses that are compared to the human smooth pursuit data. The recurrent model was tuned with the variance of pursuit responses to either "pure" {1D} or "pure" {2D} motion. The oculomotor plant was tuned with an independent set of oculomotor data, including the effects of line length (i.e. stimulus energy) and directional anisotropies in the smooth pursuit responses. The model not only provides an accurate qualitative account of dynamic motion integration but also a quantitative account that is close to the smooth pursuit response across several conditions (three contrasts and three speeds) for two human subjects.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

@article{Jones07,
	Abstract = {Although temporal coding is a frequent topic of neurophysiology research, trial-to-trial variability in temporal codes is typically dismissed as noise and thought to play no role in sensory function. Here, we show that much of this supposed '' noise'' faithfully reflects stimulus-related processes carried out in coherent neural networks. Cortical neurons responded to sensory stimuli by progressing through sequences of states, identifiable only in examinations of simultaneously recorded ensembles. The specific times at which ensembles transitioned from state to state varied from trial to trial, but the state sequences were reliable and stimulus-specific. Thus, the characterization of ensemble responses in terms of state sequences captured facets of sensory processing that are missing from, and obscured in, other analyses. This work provides evidence that sensory neurons act as parts of a systems-level dynamic process, the nature of which can best be appreciated through observation of distributed ensembles.},

	Abstract = {
                Theoretical studies suggest that primary visual cortex (area V1) uses a sparse code to efficiently represent natural scenes. This issue was investigated by recording from V1 neurons in awake behaving macaques during both free viewing of natural scenes and conditions simulating natural vision. Stimulation of the nonclassical receptive field increases the selectivity and sparseness of individual V1 neurons, increases the sparseness of the population response distribution, and strongly decorrelates the responses of neuron pairs. These effects are due to both excitatory and suppressive modulation of the classical receptive field by the nonclassical receptive field and do not depend critically on the spatiotemporal structure of the stimuli. During natural vision, the classical and nonclassical receptive fields function together to form a sparse representation of the visual world. This sparse code may be computationally efficient for both early vision and higher visual processing.

@article{Knierim92,
	Abstract = {1. We recorded responses from neurons in area V1 of the alert macaque monkey to textured patterns modeled after stimuli used in psychophysical experiments of pop-out. Neuronal responses to a single oriented line segment placed within a cell's classical receptive field ({CRF}) were compared with responses in which the center element was surrounded by rings of elements placed entirely outside the {CRF}. The orientations of the surround elements either matched the center element, were orthogonal to it, or were random. 2. The addition of the textured surround tended to suppress the response to the center element by an average of 34\%. Overall, almost 80\% of the 122 cells analyzed in detail were significantly suppressed by at least one of the texture surrounds. 3. Cells tended to respond more strongly to a stimulus in which there was a contrast in orientation between the center and surround than to a stimulus lacking such contrast. The average difference was 9\% of the response to the optimally oriented center element alone. For the 32\% of the cells showing a statistically significant orientation contrast effect, the average difference was 28\%. 4. Both the general suppression and orientation contrast effects originated from surround regions at the ends of the center bar as well as regions along the sides of the center bar. 5. The amount of suppression induced by the texture surround decreased as the density of the texture elements decreased. 6. Both the general suppression and the orientation contrast effects appeared early in the population response to the stimuli. The general suppression effect took approximately 7 ms to develop, whereas the orientation contrast effect took 18-20 ms to develop. 7. These results are consistent with a possible functional role of V1 cells in the mediation of perceptual pop-out and in the segregation of texture borders. Possible anatomic substrates of the effects are discussed.},

It is proposed that the signature for a sparse code is found in the fourth moment of the response distribution (i.e., the kurtosis).

	Abstract = {The problem of digital painting is considered from a signal processing viewpoint, and is reconsidered as a problem of directed texture synthesis. It is an important characteristic of natural texture that detail may be evident at many scales, and the detail at each scale may have distinct characteristics. A '' sparse convolution'' procedure for generating random textures with arbitrary spectral content is described. The capability of specifying the texture spectrum (and thus the amount of detail at each scale) is an improvement over stochastic texture synthesis processes which are scalebound or which have a prescribed 1/f spectrum. This spectral texture synthesis procedure provides the basis for a digital paint system which rivals the textural sophistication of traditional artistic media. Applications in terrain synthesis and texturing computer-rendered objects are also shown.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic random-dot stimuli have been widely used to explore central mechanisms of motion processing. We have measured the responses of neurons in area {MT} of the alert monkey while we varied the strength and direction of the motion signal in such displays. The strength of motion is controlled by the proportion of spatiotemporally correlated dots, which we term the correlation of the stimulus. For many {MT} cells, responses varied approximately linearly with stimulus correlation. When they occurred, nonlinearities were equally likely to be either positively or negatively accelerated. We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells' discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low-level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning.},

	Abstract = {When an observer moves forward in the environment, the image on his or her retina expands. The rate of this expansion conveys information about the observer's speed1 and the time to collision2, 3, 4. Psychophysical5, 7 and physiological8, 9 studies have provided abundant evidence that these expansionary motions are processed by specialized mechanisms in mammalian visual systems. It is commonly assumed that the rate of expansion is estimated from the divergence of the optic-flow field (the two-dimensional field of local translational velocities)10, 11, 12, 13, 14. But this rate might also be estimated from changes in the size (or scale) of image features15. To determine whether human vision uses such scale-change information, we have synthesized stochastic texture stimuli in which the scale of image elements increases gradually over time, while the optic-flow pattern is random. Here we show, using these stimuli, that observers can estimate expansion rates from scale-change information alone, and that pure scale changes can produce motion after-effects. These two findings suggest that the visual system contains mechanisms that are explicitly sensitive to changes in scale.},

@article{Victor96,
	Abstract = {Isodipole textures are pairs of texture ensembles whose autocorrelations, and hence power spectra, are equal. Examples of readily discriminable isodipole textures are well known. Such discriminations appear to require feature extraction, since the isodipole condition eliminates ensemble differences in spatial frequency content. We studied the effects of phase decorrelation on {VEP} indices of discrimination of isodipole texture pairs. Phase decorrelation, which ranged from 0.125π radians (slight randomization) to π radians (complete randomization), was introduced in two ways: by independent jittering of each spatial Fourier component, and by a product method, which preserved correlations among certain quadruples of spatial Fourier components, despite pairwise decorrelation. For the even/random isodipole texture pair, independent phase decorrelation greater than 0.5π radians markedly reduced {VEP} indices of texture discrimination for all check sizes, and eliminated them entirely for check sizes of 8 min or greater. However, the product method preserved texture discrimination signals even with complete pairwise randomization of spatial phases. For the triangle/random isodipole texture pair, both kinds of phase decorrelation eliminated {VEP} indices of texture discrimination. These results imply that isodipole texture discrimination is based on fundamentally local processing, and not on global Fourier amplitudes---since the phase manipulations which eliminate texture discrimination preserve the Fourier amplitudes. The dependence of the antisymmetric response component (the odd harmonics) on phase decorrelation and texture type is consistent with a previously proposed model for feature extraction, and leads to constraints on how texture processing is modulated by contrast. The limited contribution of global spectral characteristics for small checks is consistent with a previously identified breakdown in scale-invariant processing.},

	Abstract = {A number of studies have investigated whether human visual performance can be related to the general form of the amplitude spectra (i.e., 1/f(alpha)) of natural scenes. Here, it is argued that there are some discrepancies in the data between some of those studies and that one possible explanation for the discrepancies may be related to differences in methodology (e.g., stimuli presented to the fovea as opposed to the parafovea). We sought to resolve some of the discrepancies with two psychophysical paradigms involving alpha discrimination with visual noise and natural scene image patches presented to the fovea or parafovea. Fovea-parafovea threshold differences were apparent for stimuli possessing alpha values < 1.0, with the parafovea typically showing highest thresholds for reference alpha values in the 0.74-0.85 range. Both fovea and parafovea thresholds were lowest in the 1.2-1.4 range. In addition, we conducted a local amplitude distribution analysis (i.e., assessed local alpha) with a large set of high-resolution natural scene imagery and found that the results of that analysis provided a better account of the alpha discrimination thresholds for stimuli presented to the fovea as opposed to the parafovea.},

	Abstract = {Broadband oriented-noise masks were used to assess the orientation properties of spatial-context suppression in 'general' viewing conditions (i.e., a fixated, large field of 'naturalistic' noise). Suppression was orientation-tuned with a Gaussian shape and bandwidth of 40\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$ that was consistent across test orientation (0\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, 45\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, 90\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$, and 135\\\\\\\\$\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\,^{\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\circ}\\\\\\\\$). Strength of suppression was highly anisotropic following a '' horizontal effect'' pattern (strongest suppression at horizontal and least suppression at oblique test orientations). Next, the time course of anisotropic masking was investigated by varying stimulus onset asynchrony ({SOA}). A standard '' oblique effect'' anisotropy is observed at long {SOAs} but becomes a '' horizontal effect'' when a noise mask is present within approximately 50 ms of the test onset. The orientation-tuned masking appears to result from an anisotropic gain-control mechanism that pools the weighted responses to the broadband mask, resulting in a changeover from oblique effect to horizontal effect. In addition, the relative magnitude of suppression at the orientations tested corresponds to the relative magnitudes of the content of typical natural scenes at the same orientations. We suggest that this anisotropic suppression may serve to equalize the visual system's response across orientation when viewing typical natural scenes, 'discounting' the anisotropy of typical natural scene content.},

	Abstract = {1. The contrast thresholds of a variety of grating patterns have been measured over a wide range of spatial frequencies.2. Contrast thresholds for the detection of gratings whose luminance profiles are sine, square, rectangular or saw-tooth waves can be simply related using Fourier theory.3. Over a wide range of spatial frequencies the contrast threshold of a grating is determined only by the amplitude of the fundamental Fourier component of its wave form.4. Gratings of complex wave form cannot be distinguished from sine-wave gratings until their contrast has been raised to a level at which the higher harmonic components reach their independent threshold.5. These findings can be explained by the existence within the nervous system of linearly operating independent mechanisms selectively sensitive to limited ranges of spatial frequencies.},

@article{Tsuchiya07,
	Abstract = {We compare luminance-contrast-masking thresholds for fully and poorly attended stimuli, controlling attention with a demanding concurrent task. We use dynamic displays composed of discrete spatiotemporal wavelets, comparing three conditions ("single," "parallel," and "random"). In contrast to static displays, we do not find that attention modulates the "dipper" regime for masks of low luminance contrast. Nor does attention alter direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in random directions, a condition designed to isolate effects on component motion. However, direction-selective masking by multiple wavelets moving in parallel is significantly reduced by attention. As the latter condition is expected to excite both component and pattern motion mechanisms, this implies that attention may alter the visual representation of pattern motion. In addition, attention exhibits its well-known effect of reducing lateral masking between nearby spatiotemporal wavelets.},

@article{Chen05,
	Abstract = {Visual motion is sensed by low-level (energy-based) and high-level (feature-based) mechanisms. Our interest is in the motion detectors underlying the initial ocular following responses ({OFR}) that are elicited at ultrashort latencies by sudden motions of large images. {OFR} were elicited in humans by applying horizontal motion to vertical square-wave gratings lacking the fundamental. In the frequency domain, a pure square wave is composed of the odd harmonics--first, third, fifth, seventh, etc.--such that the third, fifth, seventh, etc., have amplitudes that are one-third, one-fifth, one-seventh, etc., that of the first, and the missing fundamental stimulus lacks the first harmonic. Motion consisted of successive quarter-wavelength steps, so the features and 4n+1 harmonics (where n = integer) shifted forward, whereas the 4n-1 harmonics--including the strongest Fourier component (the third harmonic)--shifted backward (spatial aliasing). Thus, the net Fourier energy and the {non-Fourier} features moved in opposite directions. Initial {OFR}, recorded with the search coil technique, had minimum latencies of 60 to 70 ms and were always in the direction of the third harmonic, for example, leftward steps resulted in rightward {OFR}. Thus, the earliest {OFR} were strongly dependent on the motion of the major Fourier component, consistent with mediation by oriented spatiotemporal visual filters as in the well-known energy model of motion detection. Introducing interstimulus intervals of 10 to 100 ms (during which the screen was uniform gray) reversed the initial direction of tracking, consistent with extensive neurophysiological and psychophysical data suggesting that the visual input to the motion detectors has a biphasic temporal impulse response.},

@article{Del-Viva98,
	Abstract = {We have developed a two-stage model of motion perception that identifies moving spatial features and computes their velocity, achieving both high spatial localisation and reliable estimates of velocity. Features are detected in each frame by locating the peaks of the spatial local energy functions, as for stationary images (Morrone {MC} and Burr {DC}. Proc R Soc Lond {1988;B235}:221-245.). The energy functions are calculated for different scales and orientations, and integrated within a temporal Gaussian window. The velocity of features is determined by the direction of maximal elongation of the energy in space-time, evaluated by calculating the three characteristic curvatures of the energy at each feature point. To circumvent the aperture problem, the energy maps are blurred in space by various amounts, and velocity is computed separately for each spatial blur. The Weber fraction of the local curvatures (curvature contrast) describes the spatio-temporal energy elongation at each feature point, giving a reliability index for each velocity estimate. For each point, the velocity of the spatial blur that yielded the highest curvature contrast was selected, with no further constraints, such as rigidity of motion. Dynamic recruitment of operators of different size allows maximum flexibility of the analysis, allowing it to simulate human visual performance in the detection of noise images, transparent motion, some motion illusions, and second-order motion.},

	Abstract = {The visual responses of neurons in the cerebral cortex were first adequately characterized in the 1960s by D. H. Hubel and T. N. Wiesel [(1962) J. Physiol. (London) 160, 106-154; (1968) J. Physiol. (London) 195, 215-243] using qualitative analyses based on simple geometric visual targets. Over the past 30 years, it has become common to consider the properties of these neurons by attempting to make formal descriptions of these transformations they execute on the visual image. Most such models have their roots in linear-systems approaches pioneered in the retina by C. {Enroth-Cugell} and J. R. Robson [(1966) J. Physiol. (London) 187, 517-552], but it is clear that purely linear models of cortical neurons are inadequate. We present two related models: one designed to account for the responses of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) and one designed to account for the responses of pattern direction selective cells in {MT} (or V5), an extrastriate visual area thought to be involved in the analysis of visual motion. These models share a common structure that operates in the same way on different kinds of input, and instantiate the widely held view that computational strategies are similar throughout the cerebral cortex. Implementations of these models for Macintosh microcomputers are available and can be used to explore the models' properties.},

	Abstract = {Fourier-phase information is important in determining the appearance of natural scenes, but the structure of natural-image phase spectra is highly complex and difficult to relate directly to human perceptual processes. This problem is addressed by extending previous investigations of human visual sensitivity to the randomisation and quantisation of Fourier phase in natural images. The salience of the image changes induced by these physical processes is shown to depend critically on the nature of the original phase spectrum of each image, and the processes of randomisation and quantisation are shown to be perceptually equivalent provided that they shift image phase components by the same average amount. These results are explained by assuming that the visual system is sensitive to those phase-domain image changes which also alter certain global higher-order image statistics. This assumption may be used to place constraints on the likely nature of cortical processing: mechanisms which correlate the outputs of a bank of relative-phase-sensitive units are found to be consistent with the patterns of sensitivity reported here.},

	Abstract = {Natural sounds, especially communication sounds, have highly structured amplitude and phase spectra. We have quantified how structure in the amplitude spectrum of natural sounds affects coding in primary auditory afferents. Auditory afferents encode stimuli with naturalistic amplitude spectra dramatically better than broad-band stimuli (approximating white noise); the rate at which the spike train carries information about the stimulus is 2-6 times higher for naturalistic sounds. Furthermore, the information rates can reach 90\% of the fundamental limit to information transmission set by the statistics of the spike response. These results indicate that the coding strategy of the auditory nerve is matched to the structure of natural sounds; this `tuning' allows afferent spike trains to provide higher processing centres with a more complete description of the sensory world.},

@article{Motoyoshi10,
	Abstract = {The present study analyzes the effect of local pairwise orientation relations on the perception of textural structure. We have employed a new class of stochastic stimuli comprised of paired Gabor patches with a particular orientation difference ( \^{I}¸) and relative angular position ( \"{I}). We measured the threshold proportion of signal pairs for discriminating the target texture from a noise texture comprised of randomly oriented pairs. The results showed that observers were sensitive not only to textures containing pairs with curvilinear configurations such as lines and curves ( \"{I} = \^{I}¸ / 2), but also to their orthogonal configurations such as V shapes and parallels ( \"{I} = \^{I}¸ / 2 + 90). Both classes of configuration exhibit the property of co-circularity, a fundamental geometric feature of edges and contours in natural images. We also found higher sensitivity for textures made from orientation pairs with either large or small orientation differences. These results suggest that in addition to orientation difference, co-circularity plays a critical role in the perception of orientation-based textural structure.},

@article{Samonds06,
	Abstract = {We explored how contour information in primary visual cortex might be embedded in the simultaneous activity of multiple cells recorded with a 100-electrode array. Synchronous activity in cat visual cortex was more selective and predictable in discriminating between drifting grating and concentric ring stimuli than changes in firing rate. Synchrony was found even between cells with wholly different orientation preferences when their receptive fields were circularly aligned, and membership in synchronous groups was orientation and curvature dependent. The existence of synchrony between cocircular cells reinforces its role as a general mechanism for contour integration and shape detection as predicted by association field concepts. Our data suggest that cortical synchrony results from common and synchronous input from earlier visual areas and that it could serve to shape extrastriate response selectivity.},

@article{Parent89,
	Abstract = {An approach is described for curve inference that is based on curvature information. The inference procedure is divided into two stages: a trace inference stage, which is the subject of the present work, and a curve synthesis stage. It is shown that recovery of the trace of a curve requires estimating local models for the curve at the same time, and that tangent and curvature information are sufficient. These make it possible to specify powerful constraints between estimated tangents to a curve, in terms of a neighborhood relationship called cocircularity, and between curvature estimates, in terms of a curvature consistency relation. Because all curve information is quantized, special care must be taken to obtain accurate estimates of trace points, tangents, and curvatures. This issue is addressed specifically to the introduction of a smoothness constraint and a maximum curvature constraint. The procedure is applied to two types of images: artificial images designed to evaluate curvature and noise sensitivity, and natural images},

@article{Hurlimann02,
	Abstract = {In a recent Bayesian model by Weiss, Simoncelli, and Adelson, motion perception is biased by a prior favoring slow speeds. This model predicts qualitatively an impressive variety of phenomena, including the dependence of perceived speed on contrast. We show that the model can also generate quantitative predictions: for a drifting grating with contrast c, perceived speed is proportional to c(q)/(k(q) + c(q)), with k, q constants. We tested this expression on measurements of perceived speed as a function of contrast. Observers indicated the slower of two drifting gratings, a test and a standard. For each test contrast we found the test speed that appeared to match the standard speed. The model fits the data, but only if q is less than 2, the value it would have if the internal representation of contrast were linear. The Bayesian model can make correct quantitative predictions, but needs to be extended to incorporate a more realistic, nonlinear representation of contrast.},

@article{Friston07,
	Abstract = {If one formulates Helmholtz's ideas about perception in terms of modern-day theories one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts. Using constructs from statistical physics it can be shown that the problems of inferring what cause our sensory input and learning causal regularities in the sensorium can be resolved using exactly the same principles. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. The ensuing scheme rests on Empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory information is generated. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of the brain's organisation and {responses.In} this paper, we suggest that these perceptual processes are just one emergent property of systems that conform to a free-energy principle. The free-energy considered here represents a bound on the surprise inherent in any exchange with the environment, under expectations encoded by its state or configuration. A system can minimise free-energy by changing its configuration to change the way it samples the environment, or to change its expectations. These changes correspond to action and perception respectively and lead to an adaptive exchange with the environment that is characteristic of biological systems. This treatment implies that the system's state and structure encode an implicit and probabilistic model of the environment. We will look at models entailed by the brain and how minimisation of free-energy can explain its dynamics and structure.},

@article{Friston10a,
	Abstract = {We have previously tried to explain perceptual inference and learning under a free-energy principle that pursues Helmholtz's agenda to understand the brain in terms of energy minimization. It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.},

In this review, rather than stating what is known, we attempt to estimate how much is still unknown about V1 function. In particular, we identify five problems with the current view of V1 that stem largely from experimental and theoretical biases, in addition to the contributions of nonlinearities in the cortex that are not well understood. Our purpose is to open the door to new theories, a number of which we describe, along with some proposals for testing them.},

@article{Shalev05,
	Abstract = {In many experiments, control over visual stimulation is obtained by sacrificing much of the complexity of the natural world and visual behavior. For example, stimuli are presented on iso-luminant backgrounds and they are flashed instead of swept into view via saccades. In this experiment, we investigated the influence of complex natural backgrounds and saccades on the development of orientation selectivity in macaque V1. Four conditions were compared: Bars of light were either flashed into the receptive field or brought into the {RF} through a saccade. Different flash and saccade trials were run with iso-luminant gray and natural image backgrounds. Average response amplitudes were usually lower with a natural than gray background. Comparing flash and saccade conditions gave more variable results. From cell-to-cell the flash response was higher or lower than the saccade response. The differences in average response amplitude across conditions appeared to be consistent with gain changes rather than changes in optimal orientation or tuning width. There were also significant effects of the presentation paradigm on the timing of selectivity. Orientation selectivity generally appeared slower with a natural than a gray background. Selectivity usually developed faster when stimuli appeared from a flash rather than a saccade. Comparing the least (flash/gray) and most natural (saccade/natural) paradigms, there was often a significant difference in the timing of maximal selectivity (tens of msec). These results indicate that the more natural paradigms recruit additional neural circuitry that decreases response amplitude and delays orientation selectivity. This suggests that in natural visual situations, the earliest form-selective V1 response carries potentially important information about stimulus context that is different from that available in reduced paradigms.},

@article{Benucci07,
	Abstract = {Summary The visual cortex represents stimuli through the activity of neuronal populations. We measured the evolution of this activity in space and time by imaging voltage-sensitive dyes in cat area V1. Contrast-reversing stimuli elicit responses that oscillate at twice the stimulus frequency, indicating that signals originate mostly in complex cells. These responses stand clear of the noise, whose amplitude decreases as 1/frequency, and yield high-resolution maps of orientation preference and retinotopy. We first show how these maps are combined to yield the responses to focal, oriented stimuli. We then study the evolution of the oscillating activity in space and time. In the orientation domain, it is a standing wave. In the spatial domain, it is a traveling wave propagating at 0.2--0.5 m/s. These different dynamics indicate a fundamental distinction in the circuits underlying selectivity for position and orientation, two key stimulus attributes.},

@article{Baldi09,
	Abstract = {The amount of information contained in a piece of data can be measured by the effect this data has on its observer. Fundamentally, this effect is to transform the observer's prior beliefs into posterior beliefs, according to Bayes theorem. Thus the amount of information can be measured in a natural way by the distance (relative entropy) between the prior and posterior distributions of the observer over the available space of hypotheses. This facet of information, termed '' surprise'', is important in dynamic situations where beliefs change, in particular during learning and adaptation. Surprise can often be computed analytically, for instance in the case of distributions from the exponential family, or it can be numerically approximated. During sequential Bayesian learning, surprise decreases like the inverse of the number of training examples. Theoretical properties of surprise are discussed, in particular how it differs and complements Shannon's definition of information. A computer vision neural network architecture is then presented capable of computing surprise over images and video stimuli. Hypothesizing that surprising data ought to attract natural or artificial attention systems, the output of this architecture is used in a psychophysical experiment to analyze human eye movements in the presence of natural video stimuli. Surprise is found to yield robust performance at predicting human gaze ({ROC}-like ordinal dominance score 0.7 compared to 0.8 for human inter-observer repeatability, 0.6 for simpler intensity contrast-based predictor, and 0.5 for chance). The resulting theory of surprise is applicable across different spatio-temporal scales, modalities, and levels of abstraction.},

@article{Albright02,
	Abstract = {The visual image formed on the retina represents an amalgam of visual scene properties, including the reflectances of surfaces, their relative positions, and the type of illumination. The challenge facing the visual system is to extract the "meaning" of the image by decomposing it into its environmental causes. For each local region of the image, that extraction of meaning is only possible if information from other regions is taken into account. Of particular importance is a set of image cues revealing surface occlusion and/or lighting conditions. These information-rich cues direct the perceptual interpretation of other more ambiguous image regions. This context-dependent transformation from image to perception has profound-but frequently under-appreciated-implications for neurophysiological studies of visual processing: To demonstrate that neuronal responses are correlated with perception of visual scene properties, rather than visual image features, neuronal sensitivity must be assessed in varied contexts that differentially influence perceptual interpretation. We review a number of recent studies that have used this context-based approach to explore the neuronal bases of visual scene perception.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of the Wagon Wheel Illusions---classic psychophysical phenomena---in the context of a neural network model of orientation selectivity in the visual system. We find that both the continuous Wagon Wheel Illusion ({c-WWI}) and the standard, stroboscopic Wagon Wheel Illusion ({WWI}) can be explained by a recurrent model in which the cortex provides both excitatory and inhibitory feedback to a weakly tuned input from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Comparison of data from recent psychophysics experiments with theoretical predictions derived from the network dynamics leads to excellent agreement. Conversely, this agreement confirms the validity of the model and highlights the fact that the Wagon Wheel Illusion can serve as a useful probe of the human striate cortex. We find that the {WWI} results from phase-locking in the visual system and that a circle map determines the dynamics of the illusion. Furthermore, our results suggest that the {c-WWI} is a consequence of continuous processing and cannot be used to support claims of discrete processing by the visual system.},

	Abstract = {In spiking neural networks, the information is conveyed by the spike times, that depend on the intrinsic dynamics of each neuron, the input they receive and on the connections between neurons. In this article we study the Markovian nature of the sequence of spike times in stochastic neural networks, and in particular the ability to deduce from a spike train the next spike time, and therefore produce a description of the network activity only based on the spike times regardless of the membrane potential process. To study this question in a rigorous manner, we introduce and study an event-based description of networks of noisy integrate-and-fire neurons, i.e. that is based on the computation of the spike times. We show that the firing times of the neurons in the networks constitute a Markov chain, whose transition probability is related to the probability distribution of the interspike interval of the neurons in the network. In the cases where the Markovian model can be developed, the transition probability is explicitly derived in such classical cases of neural networks as the linear integrate-and-fire neuron models with excitatory and inhibitory interactions, for different types of synapses, possibly featuring noisy synaptic integration, transmission delays and absolute and relative refractory period. This covers most of the cases that have been investigated in the event-based description of spiking deterministic neural networks.},

This is especially true in the retina, where synapses, cells, and circuitry have evolved to maximize signal-processing capacity within a thin, optically transparent tissue. For example, at some retinal synapses, single presynaptic active zones contact multiple postsynaptic targets; some individual neurons perform completely different tasks depending on visual conditions, while others execute hundreds of circuit computations in parallel; and the retinal network adapts, at various levels, to the ever-changing visual world. Each of these features reflects efficient use of limited cellular resources to optimally encode visual information. ► Receptor diversity encodes multiple information channels. ► Individual neurons perform different tasks within the retinal network. ► Local microcircuits enable parallel processing within single cells. ► Retinal synapses adapt to operate over a broad visual range.},

	Abstract = {Recent theories of motor control have proposed that the nervous system acts as a stochastically optimal controller, i.e. it plans and executes motor behaviors taking into account the nature and statistics of noise. Detrimental effects of noise are converted into a principled way of controlling movements. Attractive aspects of such theories are their ability to explain not only characteristic features of single motor acts, but also statistical properties of repeated actions. Here, we present a critical analysis of stochastic optimality in motor control which reveals several difficulties with this hypothesis. We show that stochastic control may not be necessary to explain the stochastic nature of motor behavior, and we propose an alternative framework, based on the action of a deterministic controller coupled with an optimal state estimator, which relieves drawbacks of stochastic optimality and appropriately explains movement variability.},

@article{Todorov05,
	Abstract = {Optimality principles of biological movement are conceptually appealing and straightforward to formulate. Testing them empirically, however, requires the solution to stochastic optimal control and estimation problems for reasonably realistic models of the motor task and the sensorimotor periphery. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of incorporating biologically plausible noise into such models. Here we extend the linear-quadratic-gaussian framework--currently the only framework where such problems can be solved efficiently--to include control-dependent, state-dependent, and internal noise. Under this extended noise model, we derive a coordinate-descent algorithm guaranteed to converge to a feedback control law and a nonadaptive linear estimator optimal with respect to each other. Numerical simulations indicate that convergence is exponential, local minima do not exist, and the restriction to nonadaptive linear estimators has negligible effects in the control problems of interest. The application of the algorithm is illustrated in the context of reaching movements. A Matlab implementation is available at www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/\~{}todorov.},

	Abstract = {A neural field is a continuous version of a neural network model accounting for dynamical pattern forming from populational firing activities in neural tissues. These patterns include standing bumps, moving bumps, traveling waves, target waves, breathers, and spiral waves, many of them observed in various brain areas. They can be categorized into two types: a wave-like activity spreading over the field and a particle-like localized activity. We show through numerical experiments that localized traveling excitation patterns (traveling bumps), which behave like particles, exist in a two-dimensional neural field with excitation and inhibition mechanisms. The traveling bumps do not require any geometric restriction (boundary) to prevent them from propagating away, a fact that might shed light on how neurons in the brain are functionally organized. Collisions of traveling bumps exhibit rich phenomena; they might reveal the manner of information processing in the cortex and be useful in various applications. The trajectories of traveling bumps can be controlled by external inputs.

@article{Grimbert06,
	Abstract = {We present a mathematical model of a neural mass developed by a number of people, including Lopes da Silva and Jansen. This model features three interacting populations of cortical neurons and is described by a six-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. We address some aspects of its behavior through a bifurcation analysis with respect to the input parameter of the system. This leads to a compact description of the oscillatory behaviors observed in Jansen and Rit (1995) (alpha activity) and Wendling, Bellanger, Bartolomei, and Chauvel (2000) (spike-like epileptic activity). In the case of small or slow variation of the input, the model can even be described as a binary unit. Again using the bifurcation framework, we discuss the influence of other parameters of the system on the behavior of the neural mass model.},

@article{Huys11,
	Abstract = {Hard-wired, Pavlovian, responses elicited by predictions of rewards and punishments exert significant benevolent and malevolent influences over instrumentally-appropriate actions. These influences come in two main groups, defined along anatomical, pharmacological, behavioural and functional lines. Investigations of the influences have so far concentrated on the groups as a whole; here we take the critical step of looking inside each group, using a detailed reinforcement learning model to distinguish effects to do with value, specific actions, and general activation or inhibition. We show a high degree of sophistication in Pavlovian influences, with appetitive Pavlovian stimuli specifically promoting approach and inhibiting withdrawal, and aversive Pavlovian stimuli promoting withdrawal and inhibiting approach. These influences account for differences in the instrumental performance of approach and withdrawal behaviours. Finally, although losses are as informative as gains, we find that subjects neglect losses in their instrumental learning. Our findings argue for a view of the Pavlovian system as a constraint or prior, facilitating learning by alleviating computational costs that come with increased flexibility.},

@article{Perin11,
	Abstract = {Neuronal circuitry is often considered a clean slate that can be dynamically and arbitrarily molded by experience. However, when we investigated synaptic connectivity in groups of pyramidal neurons in the neocortex, we found that both connectivity and synaptic weights were surprisingly predictable. Synaptic weights follow very closely the number of connections in a group of neurons, saturating after only 20\% of possible connections are formed between neurons in a group. When we examined the network topology of connectivity between neurons, we found that the neurons cluster into small world networks that are not scale-free, with less than 2 degrees of separation. We found a simple clustering rule where connectivity is directly proportional to the number of common neighbors, which accounts for these small world networks and accurately predicts the connection probability between any two neurons. This pyramidal neuron network clusters into multiple groups of a few dozen neurons each. The neurons composing each group are surprisingly distributed, typically more than 100 μm apart, allowing for multiple groups to be interlaced in the same space. In summary, we discovered a synaptic organizing principle that groups neurons in a manner that is common across animals and hence, independent of individual experiences. We speculate that these elementary neuronal groups are prescribed Lego-like building blocks of perception and that acquired memory relies more on combining these elementary assemblies into higher-order constructs.},

Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes.

@article{Tateno04,
	Abstract = {Neurons and dynamical models of spike generation display two different types of threshold behavior, with steady current stimulation: type 1 [the firing frequency vs. current ({f--I}) relationship is continuous at threshold) and type 2 (discontinuous {f--I})]. The dynamics at threshold can have profound effects on the encoding of input as spikes, the sensitivity of spike generation to input noise, and the coherence of population firing. We have examined the {f--I} and frequency--conductance (f--g) relationships of cells in layer 2/3 of slices of young (15--21 {DIV}) rat somatosensory cortex, focusing in detail on the nature of the threshold. Using white-noise stimulation, we also measured firing frequency and interspike interval variability as a function of noise amplitude. Regular-spiking ({RS}) pyramidal neurons show a type 1 threshold, consistent with their well-known ability to fire regularly at very low frequencies. In fast-spiking ({FS}) inhibitory interneurons, although regular firing is supported over a wide range of frequencies, there is a clear discontinuity in their {f--I} relationship at threshold (type 2), which has not previously been highlighted. {FS} neurons are unable to support maintained periodic firing below a critical frequency fc, in the range of 10 to 30 Hz. Very close to threshold, {FS} cells switch irregularly between bursts of periodic firing and subthreshold oscillations. These characteristics mean that the dynamics of {RS} neurons are well suited to encoding inputs into low-frequency firing rates, whereas the dynamics of {FS} neurons are suited to maintaining and quickly synchronizing to gamma and higher-frequency input.},

@article{Friston03,
	Abstract = {This article is about how the brain data mines its sensory inputs. There are several architectural principles of functional brain anatomy that have emerged from careful anatomic and physiologic studies over the past century. These principles are considered in the light of representational learning to see if they could have been predicted a priori on the basis of purely theoretical considerations. We first review the organisation of hierarchical sensory cortices, paying special attention to the distinction between forward and backward connections. We then review various approaches to representational learning as special cases of generative models, starting with supervised learning and ending with learning based upon empirical Bayes. The latter predicts many features, such as a hierarchical cortical system, prevalent top-down backward influences and functional asymmetries between forward and backward connections that are seen in the real brain. The key points made in this article are: (i) hierarchical generative models enable the learning of empirical priors and eschew prior assumptions about the causes of sensory input that are inherent in non-hierarchical models. These assumptions are necessary for learning schemes based on information theory and efficient or sparse coding, but are not necessary in a hierarchical context. Critically, the anatomical infrastructure that may implement generative models in the brain is hierarchical. Furthermore, learning based on empirical Bayes can proceed in a biologically plausible way. (ii) The second point is that backward connections are essential if the processes generating inputs cannot be inverted, or the inversion cannot be parameterised. Because these processes involve many-to-one mappings, are non-linear and dynamic in nature, they are generally non-invertible. This enforces an explicit parameterisation of generative models (i.e. backward connections) to afford recognition and suggests that forward architectures, on their own, are not sufficient for perception. (iii) Finally, non-linearities in generative models, mediated by backward connections, require these connections to be modulatory, so that representations in higher cortical levels can interact to predict responses in lower levels. This is important in relation to functional asymmetries in forward and backward connections that have been demonstrated empirically.},

@article{Rao99,
	Abstract = {We describe a model of visual processing in which feedback connections from a higher- to a lower-order visual cortical area carry predictions of lower-level neural activities, whereas the feedforward connections carry the residual errors between the predictions and the actual lower-level activities. When exposed to natural images, a hierarchical network of model neurons implementing such a model developed simple-cell-like receptive fields. A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

@article{Meirovithz09,
	Abstract = {Collinear proximal flankers can facilitate the detection of a low-contrast target or generate false-alarm target detection in the absence of a target. Although these effects are known to involve subthreshold neuronal interactions beyond the classical receptive field, the underlying neuronal mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging that emphasizes subthreshold population activity, at high spatial and temporal resolution and imaged the visual cortex of fixating monkeys while they were presented with a low-contrast Gabor target, embedded within collinear or orthogonal flankers. We found that neuronal activity at the target site in area primary visual cortex increased and response latency decreased due to spatial spread of activation from the flankers' site. This increased activity was smaller than expected by a linear summation. The presentation of flankers alone induced strong spatial filling-in at the target site. Importantly, the increased neuronal activity at the target site was synchronized over time, both locally and with neuronal population at the flanker's site. This onset synchronization was higher for collinear than for orthogonal flankers. We further show that synchrony is a superior code over amplitude, for discriminating collinear from orthogonal pattern. These results suggest that population synchrony can serve as a code to discriminate contextual effects.},

	Abstract = {In all sensory modalities, the data acquired by the nervous system is shaped by the biomechanics, material properties, and the morphology of the peripheral sensory organs. The rat vibrissal (whisker) system is one of the premier models in neuroscience to study the relationship between physical embodiment of the sensor array and the neural circuits underlying perception. To date, however, the three-dimensional morphology of the vibrissal array has not been characterized. Quantifying array morphology is important because it directly constrains the mechanosensory inputs that will be generated during behavior. These inputs in turn shape all subsequent neural processing in the vibrissal-trigeminal system, from the trigeminal ganglion to primary somatosensory ( '' barrel'') cortex. Here we develop a set of equations for the morphology of the vibrissal array that accurately describes the location of every point on every whisker to within

of the whisker length. Given only a whisker's identity (row and column location within the array), the equations establish the whisker's two-dimensional ({2D}) shape as well as three-dimensional ({3D}) position and orientation. The equations were developed via parameterization of {2D} and {3D} scans of six rat vibrissal arrays, and the parameters were specifically chosen to be consistent with those commonly measured in behavioral studies. The final morphological model was used to simulate the contact patterns that would be generated as a rat uses its whiskers to tactually explore objects with varying curvatures. The simulations demonstrate that altering the morphology of the array changes the relationship between the sensory signals acquired and the curvature of the object. The morphology of the vibrissal array thus directly constrains the nature of the neural computations that can be associated with extraction of a particular object feature. These results illustrate the key role that the physical embodiment of the sensor array plays in the sensing process. Animals move in order to sense the world. Sensing is thus an active process, constrained by muscle biomechanics and by the material, shape, and structure of the sensing organs. The rat vibrissal system provides an ideal model to examine how the physical embodiment of a sensory array shapes the sensing process. Rats have approximately thirty macrovibrissae (whiskers) arranged in rows and columns on each side of their face. They brush their whiskers against objects to tactually extract object features. To date, however, the three-dimensional shape of the whisker array has not been characterized. We scanned six rats to develop equations for the complete structure of the whisker array. Given only a whisker's row and column identity, the equations establish the whisker's two-dimensional shape and three-dimensional position and orientation. We used this equation-based model to simulate the whisker-object contact patterns that would be generated as a rat uses its whiskers to tactually explore objects with varying curvatures. Altering the shape of the array dramatically altered the relationship between the simulated sensory input and object curvature. The structure of the whisker array thus directly constrains spatiotemporal input patterns and thereby, the nature of the neural processing associated with extraction of particular object features.},

	Abstract = {After having underlined the ambiguities of the concept of plasticity and the dangers of its purely metaphoric use in neurobiology, it is suggested that we return to a more precise definition of the structure, the operating principles and the function of the '' systemic'' unit or '' integron'' relevant to the particular level of analysis in question. Any change can then be described as a modification of function, a change in the operation principles, or an alteration of the material structure of the system. It is suggested that the term plastic should be restricted to describing, among the possible variations in the operating principles or the function of a given system, any lasting alteration of the connectivity network of the system under the influence of an external force or environmental constraint. Therefore, systematic or random variations of performance, functional flexibility or the vicarious1 processes or strategies that can be found in a rigidly wired system are not justified examples of plasticity.},

	Abstract = {Recent research has witnessed an explosive increase in models that treat percepts as optimal probabilistic inference [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12] and [13]]. The ubiquity of partial camouflage and occlusion in natural scenes, and the demonstrated capacity of the visual system to synthesize coherent contours and surfaces from fragmented image data, has inspired numerous attempts to model visual interpolation processes as rational inference [[9], [10], [11], [12] and [13]]. Here, we report striking new forms of visual interpolation that generate highly improbable percepts. We present motion displays depicting simple occlusion sequences that elicit vivid percepts of illusory contours ({ICs}) in displays for which they play no necessary explanatory role. These {ICs} define a second, redundant occluding surface, even though all of the image data can be fully explained by an occluding surface that is clearly visible. The formation of {ICs} in these images therefore entails an extraordinarily improbable co-occurrence of two occluding surfaces that arise from the same local occlusion events. The perceived strength of the {ICs} depends on simple low-level image properties, which suggests that they emerge as the outputs of mechanisms that automatically synthesize contours from the pattern of occlusion and disocclusion of local contour segments. These percepts challenge attempts to model visual interpolation as a form of rational inference and suggest the need to consider a broader space of computational problems and/or implementation level constraints to understand their genesis.},

	Comment = {Here Bayesian is taken in the sense of global scene perception (\`{a} la Purves). More realistically, there are different time scales, one rapid, optimally coding a representation of the visual world using what is available to the processing units, that is the local viewpoint from the neuron. There is a slower time scale where, in the closed loop system of perception and action, these decisions are adjusted to give sense to a global percept. The paper says "Remarkably, however, this display evokes a very strong percept of an additional illusory surface that appears inside the square at exactly the same points of occlusion as the visible occluding discs. This percept instantiates one of the most improbable interpretations possible: two simultaneously present surfaces (one of which is plainly visible) that occlude and disocclude the same contours at exactly the same positions and times." First, I had a hard time finding this illusory contour except perhaps the simplest solution: 2 bars one vertical, one horizontal of varrying widths that occlude the square along a sinusoid in phase quadrature. Movie 5 helps seeing the wobbling surface that is referred to. As a conclusion, the argument is sound but the stimulus is perhaps not the optimal one for that argument, particularly when you know the ouchi or rotating snake illusion ("you know it's printed on paper, but it's moving!"). Indeed, the works [1-13] do not apply to the proposed stimuli. However, the goal of these papers is specific to a single problem to advance our understanding on one facet of image perception. Generic models are long-term goals.},

	Abstract = {The division of cortical visual processing into distinct dorsal and ventral streams is a key framework that has guided visual neuroscience. The characterization of the ventral stream as a 'What' pathway is relatively uncontroversial, but the nature of dorsal stream processing is less clear. Originally proposed as mediating spatial perception ('Where'), more recent accounts suggest it primarily serves non-conscious visually guided action ('How'). Here, we identify three pathways emerging from the dorsal stream that consist of projections to the prefrontal and premotor cortices, and a major projection to the medial temporal lobe that courses both directly and indirectly through the posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortices. These three pathways support both conscious and non-conscious visuospatial processing, including spatial working memory, visually guided action and navigation, respectively.},

@article{Webb11,
	Abstract = {The brain estimates visual motion by decoding the responses of populations of neurons. Extracting unbiased motion estimates from early visual cortical neurons is challenging because each neuron contributes an ambiguous (local) representation of the visual environment and inherently variable neural response. To mitigate these sources of noise, the brain can pool across large populations of neurons, pool the response of each neuron over time, or a combination of the two. Recent psychophysical and physiological work points to a flexible motion pooling system that arrives at different computational solutions over time and for different stimuli. Here we ask whether a single, likelihood-based computation can accommodate the flexible nature of spatiotemporal motion pooling in humans. We examined the contribution of different computations to human observers' performance on two global visual motion discriminations tasks, one requiring the combination of motion directions over time and another requiring their combination in different relative proportions over space and time. Observers' perceived direction of global motion was accurately predicted by a vector average readout of direction signals accumulated over time and a maximum likelihood readout of direction signals combined over space, consistent with the notion of a flexible motion pooling system that uses different computations over space and time. Additional simulations of observers' performance with a population decoding model revealed a more parsimonious solution: flexible spatiotemporal pooling could be accommodated by a single computation that optimally pools motion signals across a population of neurons that accumulate local motion signals on their receptive fields at a fixed rate over time.},

Concrete examples are taken from three areas of magic: the ability to control attention, to distort perception, and to influence choice.

	Abstract = {
                Short-latency ocular following are reflexive, tracking eye movements that are observed in human and non-human primates in response to a sudden and brief translation of the image. Initial, open-loop part of the eye acceleration reflects many of the properties attributed to low-level motion processing. We review a very large set of behavioral data demonstrating several key properties of motion detection and integration stages and their dynamics. We propose that these properties can be modeled as a behavioral receptive field exhibiting linear and nonlinear mechanisms responsible for context-dependent spatial integration and gain control. Functional models similar to that used for describing neuronal properties of receptive fields can then be applied successfully.

	Abstract = {Gaze following is a key component of human social cognition. Gaze following directs attention to areas of high information value and accelerates social, causal, and cultural learning. An issue for both robotic and infant learning is whose gaze to follow. The hypothesis tested in this study is that infants use information derived from an entity's interactions with other agents as evidence about whether that entity is a perceiver. A robot was programmed so that it could engage in communicative, imitative exchanges with an adult experimenter. Infants who saw the robot act in this social-communicative fashion were more likely to follow its line of regard than those without such experience. Infants use prior experience with the robot's interactions as evidence that the robot is a psychological agent that can see. Infants want to look at what the robot is seeing, and thus shift their visual attention to the external target.},

@article{Kim11,
	Abstract = {The ability to identify directional interactions that occur among multiple neurons in the brain is crucial to an understanding of how groups of neurons cooperate in order to generate specific brain functions. However, an optimal method of assessing these interactions has not been established. Granger causality has proven to be an effective method for the analysis of the directional interactions between multiple sets of continuous-valued data, but cannot be applied to neural spike train recordings due to their discrete nature. This paper proposes a point process framework that enables Granger causality to be applied to point process data such as neural spike trains. The proposed framework uses the point process likelihood function to relate a neuron's spiking probability to possible covariates, such as its own spiking history and the concurrent activity of simultaneously recorded neurons. Granger causality is assessed based on the relative reduction of the point process likelihood of one neuron obtained excluding one of its covariates compared to the likelihood obtained using all of its covariates. The method was tested on simulated data, and then applied to neural activity recorded from the primary motor cortex ({MI}) of a Felis catus subject. The interactions present in the simulated data were predicted with a high degree of accuracy, and when applied to the real neural data, the proposed method identified causal relationships between many of the recorded neurons. This paper proposes a novel method that successfully applies Granger causality to point process data, and has the potential to provide unique physiological insights when applied to neural spike trains. Recent advances in multiple-electrode recording have made it possible to record the activities of multiple neurons simultaneously. This provides an opportunity to study how groups of neurons form functional ensembles as different brain areas perform their various functions. However, most of the methods that attempt to identify associations between neurons provide little insight into the directional nature of the interactions that they detect. Recently, Granger causality has proven to be an efficient method to infer causal relationships between sets of continuous-valued data, but cannot be directly applied to point process data such as neural spike trains. Here, we propose a novel and successful attempt to expand the application of Granger causality to point process data. The proposed method performed well with simulated data, and was then applied to real experimental data recorded from sets of simultaneously recorded neurons from the primary motor cortex. The results of the real data analysis suggest that the proposed method has the potential to provide unique neurophysiological insights about network properties in the cortex that have not been possible with other contemporary methods of functional interaction detection.},

@article{Pashut11,
	Abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) is a stimulation method in which a magnetic coil generates a magnetic field in an area of interest in the brain. This magnetic field induces an electric field that modulates neuronal activity. The spatial distribution of the induced electric field is determined by the geometry and location of the coil relative to the brain. Although {TMS} has been used for several decades, the biophysical basis underlying the stimulation of neurons in the central nervous system ({CNS}) is still unknown. To address this problem we developed a numerical scheme enabling us to combine realistic magnetic stimulation ({MS}) with compartmental modeling of neurons with arbitrary morphology. The induced electric field for each location in space was combined with standard compartmental modeling software to calculate the membrane current generated by the electromagnetic field for each segment of the neuron. In agreement with previous studies, the simulations suggested that peripheral axons were excited by the spatial gradients of the induced electric field. In both peripheral and central neurons, {MS} amplitude required for action potential generation was inversely proportional to the square of the diameter of the stimulated compartment. Due to the importance of the fiber's diameter, magnetic stimulation of {CNS} neurons depolarized the soma followed by initiation of an action potential in the initial segment of the axon. Passive dendrites affect this process primarily as current sinks, not sources. The simulations predict that neurons with low current threshold are more susceptible to magnetic stimulation. Moreover, they suggest that {MS} does not directly trigger dendritic regenerative mechanisms. These insights into the mechanism of {MS} may be relevant for the design of multi-intensity {TMS} protocols, may facilitate the construction of magnetic stimulators, and may aid the interpretation of results of {TMS} of the {CNS}. Transcranial magnetic stimulation ({TMS}) is a widely applied tool for probing cognitive function in humans and is one of the best tools for clinical treatments and interfering with cognitive tasks. Surprisingly, while {TMS} has been commercially available for decades, the cellular mechanisms underlying magnetic stimulation remain unclear. Here we investigate these mechanisms using compartmental modeling. We generated a numerical scheme allowing simulation of the physiological response to magnetic stimulation of neurons with arbitrary morphologies and active properties. Computational experiments using this scheme suggested that {TMS} affects neurons in the central nervous system ({CNS}) primarily by somatic stimulation. Since magnetic stimulation appears to cause somatic depolarization, its effects are highly correlated with the neuron's current threshold. Our simulations therefore predict that subpopulations of {CNS} neurons with different firing thresholds will respond differently to magnetic stimulation. For example, low-intensity {TMS} may be used to stimulate low-threshold cortical inhibitory interneurons. At higher intensities we predict that both inhibitory and excitatory neurons are activated. These predictions may be tested at the cellular level and may impact cognitive experiments in humans. Furthermore, our simulations may be used to design {TMS} coils, devices and protocols.},

@article{Onat11,
	Abstract = {In early visual cortex different stimulus parameters are represented in overlaid feature maps. Such functioning was extensively explored by the use of drifting gratings characterized by orientation, spatial--temporal frequency, and direction of motion. However surprisingly, the direct cortical visuotopic drift of the gratings' stripy pattern has never been detected simultaneously to these stationary feature maps. It therefore remains to be demonstrated how physical signals of grating motion across the cortex are represented independently of other parametric maps and thus, how multi-dimensional input is processed independently to enable effective read-out further downstream. Taking advantage of the high spatial and temporal resolution of voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we here show the real-time encoding of position and orientation. By decomposing the cortical responses to drifting gratings we visualize the typical emergence of stationary orientation maps in which specific domains exhibited highest amplitudes. Simultaneously to these patchy maps, we demonstrate coherently propagating waves of activity that precisely matched the actual movement of the gratings in space and time, most dominantly for spatial frequencies lower than the preferred range. Thus, the primary visual cortex multiplexes information about retinotopic motion by additional temporal modulation of stationary orientation signals. These signals may be used to variably extract coarse-grained object motion and form information at higher visual processing stages.},

	Abstract = {Human choice behavior takes account of internal decision costs: people show a tendency to avoid making decisions in ways that are computationally demanding and subjectively effortful. Here, we investigate neural processes underlying the registration of decision costs. We report two functional {MRI} experiments that implicate lateral prefrontal cortex ({LPFC}) in this function. In Experiment 1, {LPFC} activity correlated positively with a self-report measure of costs as this measure varied over blocks of simple decisions. In Experiment 2, {LPFC} activity also correlated with individual differences in effort-based choice, taking on higher levels in subjects with a strong tendency to avoid cognitively demanding decisions. These relationships persisted even when effects of reaction time and error were partialled out, linking {LPFC} activity to subjectively experienced costs and not merely to response accuracy or time on task. In contrast to {LPFC}, dorsomedial frontal cortex---an area widely implicated in performance monitoring---showed no relationship to decision costs independent of overt performance. Previous work has implicated {LPFC} in executive control. Our results thus imply that costs may be registered based on the degree to which control mechanisms are recruited during decision-making.},

@article{Perrone08,
	Abstract = {The primate visual system faces a difficult problem whenever it encounters the motion of an object moving over a patch of the retina. Objects typically contain a number of edges at different orientations and so a range of image velocities are generated within the receptive field of a neuron processing the object movement. It is still a mystery as to how these different velocities are combined into one unified and correct velocity. Neurons in area {MT} (V5) are considered to be the neural substrate for this motion integration process. Some {MT} neurons (pattern type) respond selectively to the correct global motion of an object, whereas others respond primarily to the individual components making up the pattern (component type). Recent findings from {MT} pattern cells tested with small patches of motion (N. J. Majaj, M. Carandini, \& J. A. Movshon, 2007) have put further constraints on the possible mechanisms underlying {MT} pattern motion integration. We tested and refined an existing model of {MT} pattern neurons (J. A. Perrone, 2004) using these same small patch stimuli and found that it can accommodate these new findings. We also discovered that the speed of the test stimuli may have had an impact on the N. J. Majaj et al. (2007) results and that {MT} direction and speed tuning may be more closely linked than previously thought.},

@article{Vlachos11,
	Abstract = {The basal nucleus of the amygdala ({BA}) is involved in the formation of context-dependent conditioned fear and extinction memories. To understand the underlying neural mechanisms we developed a large-scale neuron network model of the {BA}, composed of excitatory and inhibitory leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons. Excitatory {BA} neurons received conditioned stimulus ({CS})-related input from the adjacent lateral nucleus ({LA}) and contextual input from the hippocampus or medial prefrontal cortex ({mPFC}). We implemented a plasticity mechanism according to which {CS} and contextual synapses were potentiated if {CS} and contextual inputs temporally coincided on the afferents of the excitatory neurons. Our simulations revealed a differential recruitment of two distinct subpopulations of {BA} neurons during conditioning and extinction, mimicking the activation of experimentally observed cell populations. We propose that these two subgroups encode contextual specificity of fear and extinction memories, respectively. Mutual competition between them, mediated by feedback inhibition and driven by contextual inputs, regulates the activity in the central amygdala ({CEA}) thereby controlling amygdala output and fear behavior. The model makes multiple testable predictions that may advance our understanding of fear and extinction memories.},

	Abstract = {Interaural time differences ({ITDs}) are the major cue for localizing low-frequency sounds. The activity of neuronal populations in the brainstem encodes {ITDs} with an exquisite temporal acuity of about . The response of single neurons, however, also changes with other stimulus properties like the spectral composition of sound. The influence of stimulus frequency is very different across neurons and thus it is unclear how {ITDs} are encoded independently of stimulus frequency by populations of neurons. Here we fitted a statistical model to single-cell rate responses of the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus. The model was used to evaluate the impact of single-cell response characteristics on the frequency-invariant mutual information between rate response and {ITD}. We found a rough correspondence between the measured cell characteristics and those predicted by computing mutual information. Furthermore, we studied two readout mechanisms, a linear classifier and a two-channel rate difference decoder. The latter turned out to be better suited to decode the population patterns obtained from the fitted model.},

The perceived directions of the gratings and plaids are measured in parallel psychophysical experiments. We identify a population of somatosensory neurons that exhibit integration properties comparable to those induced by analogous visual stimuli in area {MT} and find that these neural responses account for the perceived direction of the stimuli across all stimulus conditions tested.

@article{Schwager,
	Abstract = {This paper unifies and extends several different existing strategies for deploying groups of robots in an environment. A cost function is proposed that can be specialized to represent widely different multi-robot deployment tasks. It is shown that geometric and probabilistic deployment strategies that were previously seen as distinct are in fact related through this cost function, and differ only in the value of a single parameter. These strategies are also related to potential fieldbased controllers through the same cost function, though the relationship is not as simple. Distributed controllers are then obtained from the gradient of the cost function and are proved to converge to a local minimum of the cost function. Three special cases are derived as examples: a Voronoi-based coverage control task, a probabilistic minimum variance task, and a task using artificial potential fields. The performance of the three different controllers are compared in simulation. A result is also proved linking multi-robot deployment to non-convex optimization problems, and multi-robot consensus (i.e. all robots moving to the same point) to convex optimization problems, which implies that multi-robot deployment is inherently more difficult than multi-robot consensus.},

@article{Hinton10,
	Abstract = {One of the central problems in computational neuroscience is to understand how the object-recognition pathway of the cortex learns a deep hierarchy of nonlinear feature detectors. Recent progress in machine learning shows that it is possible to learn deep hierarchies without requiring any labelled data. The feature detectors are learned one layer at a time and the goal of the learning procedure is to form a good generative model of images, not to predict the class of each image. The learning procedure only requires the pairwise correlations between the activations of neuron-like processing units in adjacent layers. The original version of the learning procedure is derived from a quadratic 'energy' function but it can be extended to allow third-order, multiplicative interactions in which neurons gate the pairwise interactions between other neurons. A technique for factoring the third-order interactions leads to a learning module that again has a simple learning rule based on pairwise correlations. This module looks remarkably like modules that have been proposed by both biologists trying to explain the responses of neurons and engineers trying to create systems that can recognize objects.},

Bayesian methods have proven successful in building computational theories for perception and sensorimotor control, and psychophysics is providing a growing body of evidence that human perceptual computations are 'Bayes' optimal'. This leads to the 'Bayesian coding hypothesis': that the brain represents sensory information probabilistically, in the form of probability distributions. Several computational schemes have recently been proposed for how this might be achieved in populations of neurons. Neurophysiological data on the hypothesis, however, is almost non-existent. A major challenge for neuroscientists is to test these ideas experimentally, and so determine whether and how neurons code information about sensory uncertainty.},

@article{Perrinet10shl,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the input layer of primary visual cortex in primates develop edge-like receptive fields. One approach to understanding the emergence of this response is to state that neural activity has to efficiently represent sensory data with respect to the statistics of natural scenes. Furthermore, it is believed that such an efficient coding is achieved using a competition across neurons so as to generate a sparse representation, that is, where a relatively small number of neurons are simultaneously active. Indeed, different models of sparse coding coupled with Hebbian learning and homeostasis have been proposed that successfully match the observed emergent response. However, the specific role of homeostasis in learning such sparse representations is still largely unknown. By quantitatively assessing the efficiency of the neural representation during learning, we derive a cooperative homeostasis mechanism which optimally tunes the competition between neurons within the sparse coding algorithm. We apply this homeostasis while learning small patches taken from natural images and compare its efficiency with state-of-the-art algorithms. Results show that while different sparse coding algorithms give similar coding results, the homeostasis provides an optimal balance for the representation of natural images within the population of neurons. Competition in sparse coding is optimized when it is fair: By contributing to optimize statistical competition across neurons, homeostasis is crucial in providing a more efficient solution to the emergence of independent components.},

@article{Carlson11,
	Abstract = {Sparse coding has long been recognized as a primary goal of image transformation in the visual system. Sparse coding in early visual cortex is achieved by abstracting local oriented spatial frequencies and by excitatory/inhibitory surround modulation. Object responses are thought to be sparse at subsequent processing stages, but neural mechanisms for higher-level sparsification are not known. Here, convergent results from macaque area V4 neural recording and simulated V4 populations trained on natural object contours suggest that sparse coding is achieved in midlevel visual cortex by emphasizing representation of acute convex and concave curvature. We studied 165 V4 neurons with a random, adaptive stimulus strategy to minimize bias and explore an unlimited range of contour shapes. V4 responses were strongly weighted toward contours containing acute convex or concave curvature. In contrast, the tuning distribution in nonsparse simulated V4 populations was strongly weighted toward low curvature. But as sparseness constraints increased, the simulated tuning distribution shifted progressively toward more acute convex and concave curvature, matching the neural recording results. These findings indicate a sparse object coding scheme in midlevel visual cortex based on uncommon but diagnostic regions of acute contour curvature. Copyright {\\copyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Cerquera11,
	Abstract = {We explore how the reconstruction efficiency of fast spike population codes varies with population size, population composition and code complexity. Our study is based on experiments with moving light patterns which are projected onto the isolated retina of a turtle Pseudemys scripta elegans. The stimulus features to reconstruct are sequences of velocities kept constant throughout segments of 500 ms. The reconstruction is based on the spikes of a retinal ganglion cell ({RGC}) population recorded extracellularly via a multielectrode array. Subsequent spike sorting yields the parallel spike trains of 107 {RGCs} as input to the reconstruction method, here a discriminant analysis trained and tested in jack-knife fashion. Motivated by behavioral response times, we concentrate on fast reconstruction, i.e., within 150 ms following a trigger event defined via significant changes of the population spike rate. Therefore, valid codes involve only few (≤3) spikes per cell. Using only the latency t 1 of each cell (with reference to the trigger event) corresponds to the most parsimonious population code considered. We evaluate the gain in reconstruction efficiency when supplementing t 1 by spike times t 2 and t 3. Furthermore, we investigate whether sub-populations of smaller size benefit significantly from a selection process or whether random compilations are equally efficient. As selection criteria we try different concepts (directionality, reliability, and discriminability). Finally, we discuss the implications of a selection process and its inter-relation with code complexity for optimized reconstruction.},

We propose a principle combining time-optimal and minimum control energy criteria to account for the saccade main sequence as observed from empirical data. The model prediction revealed that the weighting factor of the energy conservation becomes more dominant than the time-optimal when the saccade amplitude is large. We demonstrate that the proposed model is a general form synthesizing the time-optimum, minimum torque change, and minimum control effort models. In addition, we show the connection between our model and the stochastic minimum variance models from the aspect of optimization.},

@article{Bays09,
	Abstract = {The mechanisms underlying visual working memory have recently become controversial. One account proposes a small number of memory '' slots,'' each capable of storing a single visual object with fixed precision. A contrary view holds that working memory is a shared resource, with no upper limit on the number of items stored; instead, the more items that are held in memory, the less precisely each can be recalled. Recent findings from a color report task have been taken as crucial new evidence in favor of the slot model. However, while this task has previously been thought of as a simple test of memory for color, here we show that performance also critically depends on memory for location. When errors in memory are considered for both color and location, performance on this task is in fact well explained by the resource model. These results demonstrate that visual working memory consists of a common resource distributed dynamically across the visual scene, with no need to invoke an upper limit on the number of objects represented.},

@article{Friston11b,
	Abstract = {We have suggested that the mirror-neuron system might be usefully understood as implementing Bayes-optimal perception of actions emitted by oneself or others. To substantiate this claim, we present neuronal simulations that show the same representations can prescribe motor behavior and encode motor intentions during action--observation. These simulations are based on the free-energy formulation of active inference, which is formally related to predictive coding. In this scheme, (generalised) states of the world are represented as trajectories. When these states include motor trajectories they implicitly entail intentions (future motor states). Optimizing the representation of these intentions enables predictive coding in a prospective sense. Crucially, the same generative models used to make predictions can be deployed to predict the actions of self or others by simply changing the bias or precision (i.e. attention) afforded to proprioceptive signals. We illustrate these points using simulations of handwriting to illustrate neuronally plausible generation and recognition of itinerant (wandering) motor trajectories. We then use the same simulations to produce synthetic electrophysiological responses to violations of intentional expectations. Our results affirm that a Bayes-optimal approach provides a principled framework, which accommodates current thinking about the mirror-neuron system. Furthermore, it endorses the general formulation of action as active inference.},

Perhaps the biggest impediment to understanding these networks is that we have no wiring diagrams of their interconnections. Even if we had a partial or complete wiring diagram, however, understanding the network would also require information about each neuron's function. Here we show that the relationship between structure and function can be studied in the cortex with a combination of in vivo physiology and network anatomy. We used two-photon calcium imaging to characterize a functional property---the preferred stimulus orientation---of a group of neurons in the mouse primary visual cortex. Large-scale electron microscopy of serial thin sections was then used to trace a portion of these neurons' local network. Consistent with a prediction from recent physiological experiments, inhibitory interneurons received convergent anatomical input from nearby excitatory neurons with a broad range of preferred orientations, although weak biases could not be rejected.},

The analysis of neuronal connectivity is possible with electron microscopy, but technological limitations have impeded the acquisition of high-resolution data on a large enough scale. Here we show, using serial block-face electron microscopy and two-photon calcium imaging, that the dendrites of mouse starburst amacrine cells make highly specific synapses with direction-selective ganglion cells depending on the ganglion cell's preferred direction. Our findings indicate that a structural (wiring) asymmetry contributes to the computation of direction selectivity. The nature of this asymmetry supports some models of direction selectivity and rules out others. It also puts constraints on the developmental mechanisms behind the formation of synaptic connections. Our study demonstrates how otherwise intractable neurobiological questions can be addressed by combining functional imaging with the analysis of neuronal connectivity using large-scale electron microscopy.},

@article{Geisler01,
	Abstract = {The human brain manages to correctly interpret almost every visual image it receives from the environment. Underlying this ability are contour grouping mechanisms that appropriately link local edge elements into global contours. Although a general view of how the brain achieves effective contour grouping has emerged, there have been a number of different specific proposals and few successes at quantitatively predicting performance. These previous proposals have been developed largely by intuition and computational trial and error. A more principled approach is to begin with an examination of the statistical properties of contours that exist in natural images, because it is these statistics that drove the evolution of the grouping mechanisms. Here we report measurements of both absolute and Bayesian edge co-occurrence statistics in natural images, as well as human performance for detecting natural-shaped contours in complex backgrounds. We find that contour detection performance is quantitatively predicted by a local grouping rule derived directly from the co-occurrence statistics, in combination with a very simple integration rule (a transitivity rule) that links the locally grouped contour elements into longer contours.},

We determine analytically the conditions for the structure of the afferent {LGN} and recurrent V1 inputs that lead to these properties for a hypercolumn composed of rate based neurons with a power-law transfer function. We investigate what are the relative contributions of single neuron and network properties in shaping the {OT} and the {CRF}. We test these results with numerical simulations of a network of conductance-based model ({CBM}) neurons and we demonstrate that they are valid and more robust here than in the rate model. The results indicate that because of the acceleration in the transfer function, described here by a power-law, the orientation tuning curves of V1 neurons are more tuned, and their {CRF} is steeper than those of their inputs. Last, we show that it is possible to account for the diversity in the measured {CRFs} by introducing heterogeneities either in single neuron properties or in the input to the neurons. We show how correlations among the parameters that characterize the {CRF} depend on these sources of heterogeneities. Comparison with experimental data suggests that both sources contribute nearly equally to the diversity of {CRF} shapes observed in V1 neurons.},

@article{Yu09,
	Abstract = {The brain exhibits remarkable facility in exerting attentional control in most circumstances, but it also suffers apparent limitations in others. The authors' goal is to construct a rational account for why attentional control appears suboptimal under conditions of conflict and what this implies about the underlying computational principles. The formal framework used is based on Bayesian probability theory, which provides a convenient language for delineating the rationale and dynamics of attentional selection. The authors illustrate these issues with the Eriksen flanker task, a classical paradigm that explores the effects of competing sensory inputs on response tendencies. The authors show how 2 distinctly formulated models, based on compatibility bias and spatial uncertainty principles, can account for the behavioral data. They also suggest novel experiments that may differentiate these models. In addition, they elaborate a simplified model that approximates optimal computation and may map more directly onto the underlying neural machinery. This approximate model uses conflict monitoring, putatively mediated by the anterior cingulate cortex, as a proxy for compatibility representation. The authors also consider how this conflict information might be disseminated and used to control processing.},

	Abstract = {Thalamic nuclei are thought to funnel sensory information to the brain's primary cortical areas, which in turn transmit signals afresh to higher cortical areas. Here we describe a direct projection in the macaque monkey from the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) to the motion-selective middle temporal area ({MTor} V5), a cortical area not previously considered 'primary'. The constituent neurons are mostly koniocellular, send virtually no collateral axons to primary visual cortex (V1) and equal about 10\% of the V1 population innervating {MT}. This pathway could explain the persistence of motion sensitivity in subjects following injury to V1, suggesting more generally that residual perception after damage in a primary area may arise from sparse thalamic input to 'secondary' cortical areas.},

There is no reason to suppose that the visual system contains motion sensors dedicated to the analysis of second-order motion. Current psychophysical and physiological data indicate that local motion sensors are selective for orientation and spatial frequency but they do not eliminate any of the three main models---the Reichardt detector, the motion-energy filter, and gradient-based sensors.

@article{Santen84,
	Abstract = {We propose a model of direction-sensitive units in human vision. It is a modified and elaborated version of a model by Reichardt [Z. Naturforsch. Teil B 12, 447 (1957)]. The model is applied to threshold experiments in which subjects view adjacent vertical bars with independently (typically sinusoidally), temporally modulated luminances. The subject must report whether the patterns moved to the left or to the right. According to the model, a basic motion-detecting unit consists of two subunits tuned to opposite directions. Each performs a spatial and temporal linear filtering of its input; outputs of the filters are multiplied, and the multiplied output is integrated (for a time that is long relative to the modulation period). The model's output consists of the difference between the subunit outputs. Direction of movement is indicated by the sign of the model output. Mathematical analysis of the model yielded several predictions that were confirmed experimentally. Specifically, we found that (1) performance with complex patterns can be predicted by spatiotemporal Fourier analysis that results in the segregation and linear addition in the output for different temporal frequencies; (2) under special conditions, performance depends on the product of adjacent bar amplitudes, offering strong support for the multiplication principle; (3) performance is unaffected by addition of stationary patterns; and (4) addition of homogeneous flicker normally produces no effect but under special conditions reverses perceived direction. These and other results confirm our model and reject several other models, including Reichardt's original model.},

	Abstract = {A motion sequence may be represented as a single pattern in x-y-t space; a velocity of motion corresponds to a three-dimensional orientation in this space. Motion sinformation can be extracted by a system that responds to the oriented spatiotemporal energy. We discuss a class of models for human motion mechanisms in which the first stage consists of linear filters that are oriented in space-time and tuned in spatial frequency. The outputs of quadrature pairs of such filters are squared and summed to give a measure of motion energy. These responses are then fed into an opponent stage. Energy models can be built from elements that are consistent with known physiology and psychophysics, and they permit a qualitative understanding of a variety of motion phenomena.},

@article{Huang09,
	Abstract = {Smooth-pursuit eye movements are variable, even when the same tracking target motion is repeated many times. We asked whether variation in pursuit could arise from noise in the response of visual motion neurons in the middle temporal visual area ({MT}). In physiological experiments, we evaluated the mean, variance, and trial-by-trial correlation in the spike counts of pairs of simultaneously recorded {MT} neurons. The correlations between responses of pairs of {MT} neurons are highly significant and are stronger when the two neurons in a pair have similar preferred speeds, directions, or receptive field locations. Spike count correlation persists when the same exact stimulus form is repeatedly presented. Spike count correlations increase as the analysis window increases because of correlations in the responses of individual neurons across time. Spike count correlations are highest at speeds below the preferred speeds of the neuron pair and increase as the contrast of a square-wave grating is decreased. In computational analyses, we evaluated whether the correlations and variation across the population response in {MT} could drive the observed behavioral variation in pursuit direction and speed. We created model population responses that mimicked the mean and variance of {MT} neural responses as well as the observed structure and amplitude of noise correlations between pairs of neurons. A vector-averaging decoding computation revealed that the observed variation in pursuit could arise from the {MT} population response, without postulating other sources of motor variation.},

Optimal occluder luminance for the perception of phantoms was measured, while occluder height and the inducing grating contrast varied. Phantom visibility was maximal when the occluder luminance was near to either the minimum or to the maximum luminance of the grating. When the occluder luminance was set between the two levels, opposite-phase illusory gratings were dominantly observed.

@article{Boerlin11,
	Abstract = {Compelling behavioral evidence suggests that humans can make optimal decisions despite the uncertainty inherent in perceptual or motor tasks. A key question in neuroscience is how populations of spiking neurons can implement such probabilistic computations. In this article, we develop a comprehensive framework for optimal, spike-based sensory integration and working memory in a dynamic environment. We propose that probability distributions are inferred spike-per-spike in recurrently connected networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. As a result, these networks can combine sensory cues optimally, track the state of a time-varying stimulus and memorize accumulated evidence over periods much longer than the time constant of single neurons. Importantly, we propose that population responses and persistent working memory states represent entire probability distributions and not only single stimulus values. These memories are reflected by sustained, asynchronous patterns of activity which make relevant information available to downstream neurons within their short time window of integration. Model neurons act as predictive encoders, only firing spikes which account for new information that has not yet been signaled. Thus, spike times signal deterministically a prediction error, contrary to rate codes in which spike times are considered to be random samples of an underlying firing rate. As a consequence of this coding scheme, a multitude of spike patterns can reliably encode the same information. This results in weakly correlated, Poisson-like spike trains that are sensitive to initial conditions but robust to even high levels of external neural noise. This spike train variability reproduces the one observed in cortical sensory spike trains, but cannot be equated to noise. On the contrary, it is a consequence of optimal spike-based inference. In contrast, we show that rate-based models perform poorly when implemented with stochastically spiking neurons.},

@article{Debono10,
	Abstract = {Humans use smooth pursuit eye movements to track moving objects of interest. In order to track an object accurately, motion signals from the target have to be integrated and segmented from motion signals in the visual context. Most studies on pursuit eye movements used small visual targets against a featureless background, disregarding the requirements of our natural visual environment. Here, we tested the ability of the pursuit and the perceptual system to integrate motion signals across larger areas of the visual field. Stimuli were random-dot kinematograms containing a horizontal motion signal, which was perturbed by a spatially localized, peripheral motion signal. Perturbations appeared in a gaze-contingent coordinate system and had a different direction than the main motion including a vertical component. We measured pursuit and perceptual direction discrimination decisions and found that both steady-state pursuit and perception were influenced most by perturbation angles close to that of the main motion signal and only in regions close to the center of gaze. The narrow direction bandwidth (26 angular degrees full width at half height) and small spatial extent (8 degrees of visual angle standard deviation) correspond closely to tuning parameters of neurons in the middle temporal area ({MT}).},

@article{Wozny10,
	Abstract = {The question of which strategy is employed in human decision making has been studied extensively in the context of cognitive tasks; however, this question has not been investigated systematically in the context of perceptual tasks. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the decision-making strategy used by human observers in a low-level perceptual task. Data from more than 100 individuals who participated in an auditory-visual spatial localization task was evaluated to examine which of three plausible strategies could account for each observer's behavior the best. This task is very suitable for exploring this question because it involves an implicit inference about whether the auditory and visual stimuli were caused by the same object or independent objects, and provides different strategies of how using the inference about causes can lead to distinctly different spatial estimates and response patterns. For example, employing the commonly used cost function of minimizing the mean squared error of spatial estimates would result in a weighted averaging of estimates corresponding to different causal structures. A strategy that would minimize the error in the inferred causal structure would result in the selection of the most likely causal structure and sticking with it in the subsequent inference of location-"model selection." A third strategy is one that selects a causal structure in proportion to its probability, thus attempting to match the probability of the inferred causal structure. This type of probability matching strategy has been reported to be used by participants predominantly in cognitive tasks. Comparing these three strategies, the behavior of the vast majority of observers in this perceptual task was most consistent with probability matching. While this appears to be a suboptimal strategy and hence a surprising choice for the perceptual system to adopt, we discuss potential advantages of such a strategy for perception.},

	Abstract = {The temporal patterning of neuronal activity may play a substantial role in the representation of sensory stimuli. One particular hypothesis suggests that visual stimuli are represented by the temporal evolution of the instantaneous firing rate averaged over a whole population of neurons. Using an implementation in a cortical type network with lateral interactions, we could previously show that this scheme can be successfully applied to a pattern recognition task. Here, we use a large set of artificially generated stimuli to investigate the coding properties of the network in detail. The temporal population code generated by the network is intrinsically invariant to stimulus translations. We show that the encoding is invariant to small deformations of the stimuli and robust with respect to static and dynamic variations in synaptic strength of the lateral connections in the network. Furthermore, we present several measures which indicate that the encoding maps the stimuli into a high-dimensional space. These results show that a temporal population code is a promising approach for the encoding of relevant stimulus properties while simultaneously discarding the irrelevant information.},

This variability is most often interpreted as `noise\&\#039;, purely detrimental to the sensory system. In this paper, we propose an alternative view in which the variability is related to the uncertainty, about world parameters, which is inherent in the sensory stimulus. Specifically, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochastic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representational scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.},

@article{Bayerl07,
	Abstract = {We have previously developed a neurodynamical model of motion segregation in cortical visual area V1 and {MT} of the dorsal stream. The model explains how motion ambiguities caused by the motion aperture problem can be solved for coherently moving objects of arbitrary size by means of cortical mechanisms. The major bottleneck in the development of a reliable biologically inspired technical system with real-time motion analysis capabilities based on this neural model is the amount of memory necessary for the representation of neural activation in velocity space. We propose a sparse coding framework for neural motion activity patterns and suggest a means by which initial activities are detected efficiently. We realize neural mechanisms such as shunting inhibition and feedback modulation in the sparse framework to implement an efficient algorithmic version of our neural model of cortical motion segregation. We demonstrate that the algorithm behaves similarly to the original neural model and is able to extract image motion from real world image sequences. Our investigation transfers a neuroscience model of cortical motion computation to achieve technologically demanding constraints such as real-time performance and hardware implementation. In addition, the proposed biologically inspired algorithm provides a tool for modeling investigations to achieve acceptable simulation time.},

Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

	Abstract = {Biphasic neural response properties, where the optimal stimulus for driving a neural response changes from one stimulus pattern to the opposite stimulus pattern over short periods of time, have been described in several visual areas, including lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}), primary visual cortex (V1), and middle temporal area ({MT}). We describe a hierarchical model of predictive coding and simulations that capture these temporal variations in neuronal response properties. We focus on the {LGN}-V1 circuit and find that after training on natural images the model exhibits the brain's {LGN}-V1 connectivity structure, in which the structure of V1 receptive fields is linked to the spatial alignment and properties of center-surround cells in the {LGN}. In addition, the spatio-temporal response profile of {LGN} model neurons is biphasic in structure, resembling the biphasic response structure of neurons in cat {LGN}. Moreover, the model displays a specific pattern of influence of feedback, where {LGN} receptive fields that are aligned over a simple cell receptive field zone of the same polarity decrease their responses while neurons of opposite polarity increase their responses with feedback. This phase-reversed pattern of influence was recently observed in neurophysiology. These results corroborate the idea that predictive feedback is a general coding strategy in the brain.},

@article{Snowden91,
	Abstract = {An important use of motion information is to segment a complex visual scene into surfaces and objects. Transparent motions present a particularly difficult problem for segmentation because more than one velocity vector occurs at each local region in the image, and current machine vision systems fail in these circumstances. The fact that motion transparency is prevalent in natural scenes, and yet artificial systems display an inability to analyze it, suggests that the primate visual system has developed specialized methods for perceiving transparent motion. Also, the currently prevalent model of physiological mechanisms for motion-direction selectivity employs inhibitory interactions between neurons; such interactions would silence neurons under transparent conditions and render the visual system blind to transparent motion. To examine how the primate visual system solves this transparency problem, we recorded the activity of direction-selective cells in the first (area V1) and in a later (area {MT}) stage in the cortical motion-processing pathway in behaving monkeys. The visual stimuli consisted of random dot patterns forming single moving surfaces, transparent surfaces, and motion discontinuities. We found that area V1 cells responded to their preferred direction of movement even under transparent conditions, whereas area {MT} cells were suppressed under the transparent condition. These data suggest a simple solution to the transparency problem at the level of area V1. More than one motion vector can be represented at a single retinal location by different subpopulations of neurons tuned to different directions of motion; these subpopulations may represent the early stage for segmenting different, transparent surfaces. The results also suggest that facilitatory mechanisms, which unlike inhibitory interactions are largely unaffected by transparent conditions, play an important role in direction selectivity in area V1. The inhibitory interactions for different motion directions for area {MT} neurons may contribute to a mechanism for smoothing or averaging the velocity field, computations thought to be necessary for reducing noise and interpolating moving surfaces from sparse information.},

The model is an implementation of the predictive coding theory of cortical function and thus provides a single computational explanation for a diverse range of neurophysiological findings. Furthermore, since predictive coding can be related to the biased competition theory and is a specific example of more general theories of hierarchical perceptual inference, the current results relate V1 response properties to a wider, more unified, framework for understanding cortical function.},

	Abstract = {Neural responses are typically characterized by computing the mean firing rate, but response variability can exist across trials. Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.},

@article{Busing10,
	Abstract = {Reservoir computing ({RC}) systems are powerful models for online computations on input sequences. They consist of a memoryless readout neuron that is trained on top of a randomly connected recurrent neural network. {RC} systems are commonly used in two flavors: with analog or binary (spiking) neurons in the recurrent circuits. Previous work indicated a fundamental difference in the behavior of these two implementations of the {RC} idea. The performance of an {RC} system built from binary neurons seems to depend strongly on the network connectivity structure. In networks of analog neurons, such clear dependency has not been observed. In this letter, we address this apparent dichotomy by investigating the influence of the network connectivity (parameterized by the neuron in-degree) on a family of network models that interpolates between analog and binary networks. Our analyses are based on a novel estimation of the Lyapunov exponent of the network dynamics with the help of branching process theory, rank measures that estimate the kernel quality and generalization capabilities of recurrent networks, and a novel mean field predictor for computational performance. These analyses reveal that the phase transition between ordered and chaotic network behavior of binary circuits qualitatively differs from the one in analog circuits, leading to differences in the integration of information over short and long timescales. This explains the decreased computational performance observed in binary circuits that are densely connected. The mean field predictor is also used to bound the memory function of recurrent circuits of binary neurons.},

	Abstract = {Neural circuits display complex activity patterns both spontaneously and when responding to a stimulus or generating a motor output. How are these two forms of activity related? We develop a procedure called {FORCE} learning for modifying synaptic strengths either external to or within a model neural network to change chaotic spontaneous activity into a wide variety of desired activity patterns. {FORCE} learning works even though the networks we train are spontaneously chaotic and we leave feedback loops intact and unclamped during learning. Using this approach, we construct networks that produce a wide variety of complex output patterns, input-output transformations that require memory, multiple outputs that can be switched by control inputs, and motor patterns matching human motion capture data. Our results reproduce data on premovement activity in motor and premotor cortex, and suggest that synaptic plasticity may be a more rapid and powerful modulator of network activity than generally appreciated.},

	Abstract = {Mathematical models of scientific data can be formally compared using Bayesian model evidence. Previous applications in the biological sciences have mainly focussed on model selection in which one first selects the model with the highest evidence and then makes inferences based on the parameters of that model. This \^{a}€{{{{{{{{{{{{{\oe}}}}}}}}}}}}}best model\^{a}€� approach is very useful but can become brittle if there are a large number of models to compare, and if different subjects use different models. To overcome this shortcoming we propose the combination of two further approaches: (i) family level inference and (ii) Bayesian model averaging within families. Family level inference removes uncertainty about aspects of model structure other than the characteristic of interest. For example: What are the inputs to the system? Is processing serial or parallel? Is it linear or nonlinear? Is it mediated by a single, crucial connection? We apply Bayesian model averaging within families to provide inferences about parameters that are independent of further assumptions about model structure. We illustrate the methods using Dynamic Causal Models of brain imaging data.},

	Abstract = {Complex real-time computations on multi-modal time-varying input streams are carried out by generic cortical microcircuits. Obstacles for the development of adequate theoretical models that could explain the seemingly universal power of cortical microcircuits for real-time computing are the complexity and diversity of their computational units (neurons and synapses), as well as the traditional emphasis on offline computing in almost all theoretical approaches towards neural computation. In this article, we initiate a rigorous mathematical analysis of the real-time computing capabilities of a new generation of models for neural computation, liquid state machines, that can be implemented with---in fact benefit from---diverse computational units. Hence, realistic models for cortical microcircuits represent special instances of such liquid state machines, without any need to simplify or homogenize their diverse computational units. We present proofs of two theorems about the potential computational power of such models for real-time computing, both on analog input streams and for spike trains as inputs.},

	Abstract = {Depending on the connectivity, recurrent networks of simple computational units can show very different types of dynamics, ranging from totally ordered to chaotic. We analyze how the type of dynamics (ordered or chaotic) exhibited by randomly connected networks of threshold gates driven by a time-varying input signal depends on the parameters describing the distribution of the connectivity matrix. In particular, we calculate the critical boundary in parameter space where the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics takes place. Employing a recently developed framework for analyzing real-time computations, we show that only near the critical boundary can such networks perform complex computations on time series. Hence, this result strongly supports conjectures that dynamical systems that are capable of doing complex computational tasks should operate near the edge of chaos, that is, the transition from ordered to chaotic dynamics.},

@article{Maass02,
	Abstract = {A key challenge for neural modeling is to explain how a continuous stream of multimodal input from a rapidly changing environment can be processed by stereotypical recurrent circuits of integrate-and-fire neurons in real time. We propose a new computational model for real-time computing on time-varying input that provides an alternative to paradigms based on Turing machines or attractor neural networks. It does not require a task-dependent construction of neural circuits. Instead, it is based on principles of high-dimensional dynamical systems in combination with statistical learning theory and can be implemented on generic evolved or found recurrent circuitry. It is shown that the inherent transient dynamics of the high-dimensional dynamical system formed by a sufficiently large and heterogeneous neural circuit may serve as universal analog fading memory. Readout neurons can learn to extract in real time from the current state of such recurrent neural circuit information about current and past inputs that may be needed for diverse tasks. Stable internal states are not required for giving a stable output, since transient internal states can be transformed by readout neurons into stable target outputs due to the high dimensionality of the dynamical system. Our approach is based on a rigorous computational model, the liquid state machine, that, unlike Turing machines, does not require sequential transitions between well-defined discrete internal states. It is supported, as the Turing machine is, by rigorous mathematical results that predict universal computational power under idealized conditions, but for the biologically more realistic scenario of real-time processing of time-varying inputs. Our approach provides new perspectives for the interpretation of neural coding, the design of experiments and data analysis in neurophysiology, and the solution of problems in robotics and neurotechnology.},

	Abstract = {We describe a three--dimensional geometric hand model suitable for visual tracking applications. The kinematic constraints implied by the model's joints have a probabilistic structure which is well described by a graphical model. Inference in this model is complicated by the hand's many degrees of freedom, as well as multimodal likelihoods caused by ambiguous image measurements. We use nonparametric belief propagation ({NBP}) to develop a tracking algorithm which exploits the graph's structure to control complexity, while avoiding costly discretization. While kinematic constraints naturally have a local structure, self-- occlusions created by the imaging process lead to complex interpendencies in color and edge--based likelihood functions. However, we show that local structure may be recovered by introducing binary hidden variables describing the occlusion state of each pixel. We augment the {NBP} algorithm to infer these occlusion variables in a distributed fashion, and then analytically marginalize over them to produce hand position estimates which properly account for occlusion events. We provide simulations showing that {NBP} may be used to refine inaccurate model initializations, as well as track hand motion through extended image sequences. 1},

	Abstract = {Our current understanding of the primate cerebral cortex (neocortex) and in particular the posterior, sensory association cortex has matured to a point where it is possible to develop a family of graphical models that capture the structure, scale and power of the neocortex for purposes of associative recall, sequence prediction and pattern completion among other functions. Implementing such models using readily available computing clusters is now within the grasp of many labs and would provide scientists with the opportunity to experiment with both hard-wired connection schemes and structure-learning algorithms inspired by animal learning and developmental studies. While neural circuits involving structures external to the neocortex such as the thalamic nuclei are less well understood, the availability of a computational model on which to test hypotheses would likely accelerate our understanding of these circuits. Furthermore, the existence of an agreed-upon cortical substrate would not only facilitate our understanding of the brain but enable researchers to combine lessons learned from biology with state-of-the-art graphical-model and machine-learning techniques to design hybrid systems that combine the best of biological and traditional computing approaches.},

	Comment = {from their paper: "Particle filtering is another candidate for inference in Lee and Mumford's hierarchical Bayesian model; particle fil- tering generalizes the Kalman filter and dispenses with the restrictive requirements of Gaussian noise and linear dy- namics. Particle filtering operates much like Pearl's belief- propagation algorithm in which regions corresponding to random variables in the graphical model communicate by message passing. Communication can be asynchronous pro- viding a computationally simple framework not unlike that hypothesized for communication among regions in the vi- sual cortex. By combining belief propagation with parti- cle filtering, Lee and Mumford anticipated algorithms for approximate inference via non-parametric belief propaga- tion (Isard 2003; Sudderth et al. 2003). Instead of inferring a single preferred feature value xi for the ith region in the cortical hierarchy, particle filtering gen- erates a set of n values {x(1), x(2), ..., x(n)}, one for each iii region. The n values constitute a sample of the distribution associated with ith region and serve as a proxy for the full distribution thereby avoiding the problem of keeping track of the potentially exponential number of possible states of the system. Lee and Mumford relate the algorithmic behav- ior of particle filtering to the ideas of Zemel and others on population coding (Zemel 2000)."},

	Abstract = {The inverted pendulum represents an example of a nonlinear and unstable dynamic system whose properties and related control strategies have been studied extensively in the control literature. A basic setup consists of a translation device - the cart - and a rotating boom - the pendulum - which is balanced in its upright position. The control algorithm uses the position of the cart and the rotation angle of the pendulum as input measurements provided by different sensors. While contacting sensor principles such as angle encoders have been used in different demonstrators, we present a purely vision-based tracking system. In combination with state of the art control algorithms our system is able to swing-up and balance the pendulum. The presented setup is non-contacting and does not require specific visual markers on any part of the pendulum. We use off-the-shelf components to realise the monocular tracking system. Experimental results show that our system is able to robustly control the inverted pendulum in real-time on a standard desktop {PC}.},

@article{Lee03,
	Abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract local features from a visual scene. The extracted information is then channeled through a feedforward chain of modules in successively higher visual areas for further analysis. Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations. We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the plausibility of these ideas.},

@article{Jackson10,
	Abstract = {Recent computational models of biological motion perception operate on ambiguous two-dimensional representations of the body (e.g., snapshots, posture templates) and contain no explicit means for disambiguating the three-dimensional orientation of a perceived human figure. Are there neural mechanisms in the visual system that represent a moving human figure's orientation in three dimensions? To isolate and characterize the neural mechanisms mediating perception of biological motion, we used an adaptation paradigm together with bistable point-light ({PL}) animations whose perceived direction of heading fluctuates over time. After exposure to a {PL} walker with a particular stereoscopically defined heading direction, observers experienced a consistent aftereffect: a bistable {PL} walker, which could be perceived in the adapted orientation or reversed in depth, was perceived predominantly reversed in depth. A phase-scrambled adaptor produced no aftereffect, yet when adapting and test walkers differed in size or appeared on opposite sides of fixation aftereffects did occur. Thus, this heading direction aftereffect cannot be explained by local, disparity-specific motion adaptation, and the properties of scale and position invariance imply higher-level origins of neural adaptation. Nor is disparity essential for producing adaptation: when suspended on top of a stereoscopically defined, rotating globe, a context-disambiguated "globetrotter" was sufficient to bias the bistable walker's direction, as were full-body adaptors. In sum, these results imply that the neural signals supporting biomotion perception integrate information on the form, motion, and three-dimensional depth orientation of the moving human figure. Models of biomotion perception should incorporate mechanisms to disambiguate depth ambiguities in two-dimensional body representations.},

@article{Blake89,
	Abstract = {When the two eyes view discrepant monocular stimuli, stable single vision gives way to alternating periods of monocular dominance; this is the well-known but little understood phenomenon of binocular rivalry. This article develops a neural theory of binocular rivalry that treats the phenomenon as the default outcome when binocular correspondence cannot be established. The theory posits the existence of monocular and binocular neurons arrayed within a functional processing module, with monocular neurons playing a crucial role in signaling the stimulus conditions instigating rivalry and generating inhibitory signals to implement suppression. Suppression is conceived as a local process happening in parallel over the entire cortical representation of the binocular visual field. The strength of inhibition causing suppression is related to the size of the pool of monocular neurons innervated by the suppressed eye, and the duration of a suppression phase is attributed to the strength of excitation generated by the suppressed stimulus. The theory is compared with three other contemporary theories of binocular rivalry. The article closes with a discussion of some of the unresolved problems related to the theory.},

@article{Conway03,
	Abstract = {We used one-dimensional sparse noise stimuli to generate first-order spatiotemporal maps and second-order two-bar interaction maps for 65 simple and 124 complex direction-selective cells in alert macaque V1. Spatial and temporal phase differences between light and dark space-time maps clearly distinguished simple and complex cell populations. Complex cells usually showed similar direction preferences to light and dark bars, but many of the directional simple cells were much more direction selective to one sign of contrast than the reverse. We show that this is predicted by a simple energy model. Some of the direction-selective simple cells showed multiple space-time-slanted subregions, but others (previously described as S1 cells) had space-time maps that looked like just one subregion of an ordinary simple cell. Both simple and complex cells showed directional interactions (nonlinearities) to pairs of flashed bars (a 2-bar apparent-motion stimulus). The space-time slant of the simple cells correlated with the optimum {dX}/{dT} (velocity) of the paired-bar interactions. Some complex cells also showed a space-time slant; the direction of the slant usually correlated with the preferred direction of motion, but the degree of slant correlated with the inferred velocity tuning only when measured by a weighted-centroid calculation. Principal components analysis of the simple-cell space-time maps yielded one fast temporally biphasic component and a slower temporally monophasic component. We saw no consistent pattern for the spatial phase of the components, unlike previous reports; however, we show that principal components analysis may not distinguish between spatial offsets and phase offsets.},

@article{Wang11,
	Abstract = {Motion-in-depth causes changes in the size of retinal images in addition to producing optic flow patterns. A previous psychophysical study showed that human subjects can perceive expansion motion in texture stimuli that exhibit increases in the scale of image elements but no consistent optic flow pattern. The neural mechanisms by which the scale-change information is processed remain unknown. Here, we measured the responses of cat V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus ({LGN}) neurons to a sequence of random images whose spatial frequency spectrum changed over time (i.e., average spatial scale expanded or contracted). We found that V1 neurons exhibit direction sensitivity to scale changes, with more cells preferring expansion than contraction motion. This direction sensitivity can be partly accounted for by the spectrotemporal receptive field of V1 neurons. Comparison of the direction sensitivity between V1 and {LGN} neurons showed that the sensitivity in V1 may originate from {LGN} neurons. Repetitive stimulation with expansion or contraction motion can decrease the sensitivity to the adapted direction in V1, and the effect can be transferred interocularly, suggesting that intracortical connections may be critically involved in the adaptation. Together, our results suggest that direction sensitivity to scale change in V1 may contribute to motion-in-depth processing.},

@article{Kleef10,
	Abstract = {Simple cells in the primary visual cortex have segregated {ON} and {OFF} subregions in their receptive fields, while complex cells have overlapping {ON} and {OFF} subregions. These two cell types form the extremes at each end of a continuum of receptive field types. Hubel and Wiesel in 1962 suggested a hierarchical scheme of processing whereby spatially offset simple cells drive complex cells. Simple and complex cells are often classified by their responses to moving sine wave gratings: simple cells have oscillatory responses while complex cells produce unmodulated responses. Here, using moving gratings as stimuli, we show that a significant number of cells that display low levels of response modulation at high contrasts demonstrate high levels of response modulation at low contrasts. Most often a drifting low contrast grating generates a large phasic response at the fundamental frequency of the grating (F1) and a smaller but significant phasic response that is approximately 180 deg out-of-phase with the F1 component. We present several models capable of capturing the effects of stimulus contrast on complex cell responses. The model that best reproduces our experimental results is a variation of the classical hierarchical model. In our model several spatially offset simple cells provide input to a complex cell, with each simple cell exhibiting a different contrast response function. At low contrasts only one of these simple cells is sufficiently excited to reveal its receptive field properties. As contrast is increased additional spatially offset simple cells with higher contrast thresholds add their responses to the overall spiking activity.},

@article{Westheimer09,
	Abstract = {Anatomical superposition of the cortical projections from the overlapping visual fields of the two eyes does not make it obvious how the disposition of objects in the third dimension is encoded. Hubel and Wiesel's demonstration that units in the primary visual cortex of the mammal respond preferentially to elongated contours of specific orientation encouraged the inquiry into whether binocular disparity might not similarly be represented as an attribute interdigitated within the orderly progression of position. When this was found to indeed be the case, this entrained a brisk research activity into the disparity of receptive fields of single units in the primary visual cortex and the influence on their response of the three-dimensional locations of outside world stimuli. That cells' preferred orientations covered the whole gamut whereas space perception required only horizontal disparity was an apparent paradox that needed resolution. A connection with an observer's stereoscopic performance was made by the discovery that cells in the primate primary visual cortex display good tuning to the disparity in random-dot stereograms. But a wide gap still remains between the properties of these cortical units and human stereo thresholds in simple target configurations, let alone depth judgments in which perceptual and cognitive factors enter. When the neural circuits in the primary visual cortex that are involved in processing depth are eventually traced in detail they will also need to have properties that allow for the plasticity in learning and experience.},

@article{Mante05,
	Abstract = {
                A recent optical imaging study of primary visual cortex (V1) by Basole, White, and Fitzpatrick demonstrated that maps of preferred orientation depend on the choice of stimuli used to measure them. These authors measured population responses expressed as a function of the optimal orientation of long drifting bars. They then varied bar length, direction, and speed and found that stimuli of a same orientation can elicit different population responses and stimuli with different orientation can elicit similar population responses. We asked whether these results can be explained from known properties of V1 receptive fields. We implemented an "energy model" where a receptive field integrates stimulus energy over a region of three-dimensional frequency space. The population of receptive fields defines a volume of visibility, which covers all orientations and a plausible range of spatial and temporal frequencies. This energy model correctly predicts the population response to bars of different length, direction, and speed and explains the observations made with optical imaging. The model also readily explains a related phenomenon, the appearance of motion streaks for fast-moving dots. We conclude that the energy model can be applied to activation maps of V1 and predicts phenomena that may otherwise appear to be surprising. These results indicate that maps obtained with optical imaging reflect the layout of neurons selective for stimulus energy, not for isolated stimulus features such as orientation, direction, and speed.

@article{Worgotter98,
	Abstract = {To extract important information from the environment on a useful timescale, the visual system must be able to adapt rapidly to constantly changing scenes. This requires dynamic control of visual resolution, possibly at the level of the responses of single neurons. Individual cells in the visual cortex respond to light stimuli on particular locations (receptive fields) on the retina, and the structure of these receptive fields can change in different contexts1, 2, 3, 4. Here we show experimentally that the shape of receptive fields in the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats undergoes significant modifications, which are correlated with the general state of the brain as assessed by electroencephalography: receptive fields are wider during synchronized states and smaller during non-synchronized states. We also show that cortical receptive fields shrink over time when stimulated with flashing light spots. Finally, by using a network model we account for the changing size of the cortical receptive fields by dynamically rescaling the levels of excitation and inhibition in the visual thalamus and cortex. The observed dynamic changes in the sizes of the cortical receptive field could be a reflection of a process that adapts the spatial resolution within the primary visual pathway to different states of excitability.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of response latencies shows that when an image is presented to the visual system, neuronal activity is rapidly routed to a large number of visual areas. However, the activity of cortical neurons is not determined by this feedforward sweep alone. Horizontal connections within areas, and higher areas providing feedback, result in dynamic changes in tuning. The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

	Abstract = {The electrochemical processes that underlie neural function manifest themselves in ceaseless spatiotemporal field fluctuations. However, extracellular fields feed back onto the electric potential across the neuronal membrane via ephaptic coupling, independent of synapses. The extent to which such ephaptic coupling alters the functioning of neurons under physiological conditions remains unclear. To address this question, we stimulated and recorded from rat cortical pyramidal neurons in slices with a 12-electrode setup. We found that extracellular fields induced ephaptically mediated changes in the somatic membrane potential that were less than 0.5 {mV} under subthreshold conditions. Despite their small size, these fields could strongly entrain action potentials, particularly for slow (<8 Hz) fluctuations of the extracellular field. Finally, we simultaneously measured from up to four patched neurons located proximally to each other. Our findings indicate that endogenous brain activity can causally affect neural function through field effects under physiological conditions.},

@article{Ostojic11,
	Abstract = {Neurons transform time-varying inputs into action potentials emitted stochastically at a time dependent rate. The mapping from current input to output firing rate is often represented with the help of phenomenological models such as the linear-nonlinear ({LN}) cascade, in which the output firing rate is estimated by applying to the input successively a linear temporal filter and a static non-linear transformation. These simplified models leave out the biophysical details of action potential generation. It is not a priori clear to which extent the input-output mapping of biophysically more realistic, spiking neuron models can be reduced to a simple linear-nonlinear cascade. Here we investigate this question for the leaky integrate-and-fire ({LIF}), exponential integrate-and-fire ({EIF}) and conductance-based {Wang-Buzs\'{a}ki} models in presence of background synaptic activity. We exploit available analytic results for these models to determine the corresponding linear filter and static non-linearity in a parameter-free form. We show that the obtained functions are identical to the linear filter and static non-linearity determined using standard reverse correlation analysis. We then quantitatively compare the output of the corresponding linear-nonlinear cascade with numerical simulations of spiking neurons, systematically varying the parameters of input signal and background noise. We find that the {LN} cascade provides accurate estimates of the firing rates of spiking neurons in most of parameter space. For the {EIF} and {Wang-Buzs\'{a}ki} models, we show that the {LN} cascade can be reduced to a firing rate model, the timescale of which we determine analytically. Finally we introduce an adaptive timescale rate model in which the timescale of the linear filter depends on the instantaneous firing rate. This model leads to highly accurate estimates of instantaneous firing rates. Deciphering the encoding of information in the brain implies understanding how individual neurons emit action potentials ({APs}) in response to time-varying stimuli. This task is made difficult by two facts: (i) although the biophysics of {AP} generation are well understood, the dynamics of the membrane potential in response to a time-varying input are highly complex; (ii) the firing of {APs} in response to a given stimulus is inherently stochastic as only a fraction of the inputs to a neuron are directly controlled by the stimulus, the remaining being due to the fluctuating activity of the surrounding network. As a result, the input-output transform of individual neurons is often represented with the help of simplified phenomenological models that do not take into account the biophysical details. In this study, we directly relate a class of such phenomenological models, the so called linear-nonlinear models, with more biophysically detailed spiking neuron models. We provide a quantitative mapping between the two classes of models, and show that the linear-nonlinear models provide a good approximation of the input-output transform of spiking neurons, as long as the fluctuating inputs from the surrounding network are not exceedingly weak.},

	Abstract = {Recently, evidence has emerged that humans approach learning using Bayesian updating rather than (model-free) reinforcement algorithms in a six-arm restless bandit problem. Here, we investigate what this implies for human appreciation of uncertainty. In our task, a Bayesian learner distinguishes three equally salient levels of uncertainty. First, the Bayesian perceives irreducible uncertainty or risk: even knowing the payoff probabilities of a given arm, the outcome remains uncertain. Second, there is (parameter) estimation uncertainty or ambiguity: payoff probabilities are unknown and need to be estimated. Third, the outcome probabilities of the arms change: the sudden jumps are referred to as unexpected uncertainty. We document how the three levels of uncertainty evolved during the course of our experiment and how it affected the learning rate. We then zoom in on estimation uncertainty, which has been suggested to be a driving force in exploration, in spite of evidence of widespread aversion to ambiguity. Our data corroborate the latter. We discuss neural evidence that foreshadowed the ability of humans to distinguish between the three levels of uncertainty. Finally, we investigate the boundaries of human capacity to implement Bayesian learning. We repeat the experiment with different instructions, reflecting varying levels of structural uncertainty. Under this fourth notion of uncertainty, choices were no better explained by Bayesian updating than by (model-free) reinforcement learning. Exit questionnaires revealed that participants remained unaware of the presence of unexpected uncertainty and failed to acquire the right model with which to implement Bayesian updating.},

	Abstract = {Photoreception in the mammalian retina is not restricted to rods and cones but extends to a subset of retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin ({mRGCs}). These {mRGCs} are known to drive such reflex light responses as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. By contrast, until now there has been no direct assessment of their contribution to conventional visual pathways. Here, we address this deficit. Using new reporter lines, we show that {mRGC} projections are much more extensive than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus ({dLGN}), origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We continue to show that this input supports extensive physiological light responses in the {dLGN} and visual cortex in mice lacking rods+cones (a model of advanced retinal degeneration). Moreover, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, we reveal strong melanopsin input to the \~{}40\% of neurons in the {LGN} that show sustained activation to a light step. We demonstrate that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. The implication that melanopsin is required to accurately encode stimulus irradiance is confirmed using melanopsin knockout mice. Our data establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods+cones. These findings identify {mRGCs} as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicate that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.},

	Abstract = {Selection of an optimal estimator typically relies on either supervised training samples (pairs of measurements and their associated true values) or a prior probability model for the true values. Here, we consider the problem of obtaining a least squares estimator given a measurement process with known statistics (i.e., a likelihood function) and a set of unsupervised measurements, each arising from a corresponding true value drawn randomly from an unknown distribution. We develop a general expression for a nonparametric empirical Bayes least squares ({NEBLS}) estimator, which expresses the optimal least squares estimator in terms of the measurement density, with no explicit reference to the unknown (prior) density. We study the conditions under which such estimators exist and derive specific forms for a variety of different measurement processes. We further show that each of these {NEBLS} estimators may be used to express the mean squared estimation error as an expectation over the measurement density alone, thus generalizing Stein's unbiased risk estimator ({SURE}), which provides such an expression for the additive gaussian noise case. This error expression may then be optimized over noisy measurement samples, in the absence of supervised training data, yielding a generalized {SURE}-optimized parametric least squares ({SURE2PLS}) estimator. In the special case of a linear parameterization (i.e., a sum of nonlinear kernel functions), the objective function is quadratic, and we derive an incremental form for learning this estimator from data. We also show that combining the {NEBLS} form with its corresponding generalized {SURE} expression produces a generalization of the score-matching procedure for parametric density estimation.

	Abstract = {Normal sensory experience rarely presents us with isolated bars, gratings, or other stimuli that have shaped our knowledge of sensory representations. Instead, typical input adheres to certain statistical regularities, which make it 'natural' and cannot be adequately modeled by linear superposition of simple stimuli. Natural stimuli necessitate a paradigm shift with a focus on downstream processing. This shift currently follows three main lines: quantification of the information a downstream area can read out (decoding); describing a representation as the optimization of computational principles with respect to natural input (normative approach); understanding the sensory representation as optimal for the systems' tasks and intended actions (behavioral context). The interaction between representational levels, intermediate-level features, and bidirectional coupling through attention are key elements for sensory processing.},

@article{Kouh08,
	Abstract = {doi: 10.1162/neco.2008.02-07-466 A few distinct cortical operations have been postulated over the past few years, suggested by experimental data on nonlinear neural response across different areas in the cortex. Among these, the energy model proposes the summation of quadrature pairs following a squaring nonlinearity in order to explain phase invariance of complex V1 cells. The divisive normalization model assumes a gain-controlling, divisive inhibition to explain sigmoid-like response profiles within a pool of neurons. A gaussian-like operation hypothesizes a bell-shaped response tuned to a specific, optimal pattern of activation of the presynaptic inputs. A max-like operation assumes the selection and transmission of the most active response among a set of neural inputs. We propose that these distinct neural operations can be computed by the same canonical circuitry, involving divisive normalization and polynomial nonlinearities, for different parameter values within the circuit. Hence, this canonical circuit may provide a unifying framework for several circuit models, such as the divisive normalization and the energy models. As a case in point, we consider a feedforward hierarchical model of the ventral pathway of the primate visual cortex, which is built on a combination of the gaussian-like and max-like operations. We show that when the two operations are approximated by the circuit proposed here, the model is capable of generating selective and invariant neural responses and performing object recognition, in good agreement with neurophysiological data.},

@article{Engineer11,
	Abstract = {Brain changes in response to nerve damage or cochlear trauma can generate pathological neural activity that is believed to be responsible for many types of chronic pain and tinnitus. Several studies have reported that the severity of chronic pain and tinnitus is correlated with the degree of map reorganization in somatosensory and auditory cortex, respectively. Direct electrical or transcranial magnetic stimulation of sensory cortex can temporarily disrupt these phantom sensations. However, there is as yet no direct evidence for a causal role of plasticity in the generation of pain or tinnitus. Here we report evidence that reversing the brain changes responsible can eliminate the perceptual impairment in an animal model of noise-induced tinnitus. Exposure to intense noise degrades the frequency tuning of auditory cortex neurons and increases cortical synchronization. Repeatedly pairing tones with brief pulses of vagus nerve stimulation completely eliminated the physiological and behavioural correlates of tinnitus in noise-exposed rats. These improvements persisted for weeks after the end of therapy. This method for restoring neural activity to normal may be applicable to a variety of neurological disorders.},

To address this gap, we conducted a new study in a rare human patient, {SM}, who has focal bilateral amygdala lesions [4]. To provoke fear in {SM}, we exposed her to live snakes and spiders, took her on a tour of a haunted house, and showed her emotionally evocative films. On no occasion did {SM} exhibit fear, and she never endorsed feeling more than minimal levels of fear. Likewise, across a large battery of self-report questionnaires, 3 months of real-life experience sampling, and a life history replete with traumatic events, {SM} repeatedly demonstrated an absence of overt fear manifestations and an overall impoverished experience of fear. Despite her lack of fear, {SM} is able to exhibit other basic emotions and experience the respective feelings. The findings support the conclusion that the human amygdala plays a pivotal role in triggering a state of fear and that the absence of such a state precludes the experience of fear itself.},

Variational filtering is a stochastic scheme that propagates particles over a changing variational energy landscape, such that their sample density approximates the conditional density of hidden and states and inputs. The key innovation, on which variational filtering rests, is a formulation in generalised coordinates of motion. This renders the scheme much simpler and more versatile than existing approaches, such as those based on particle filtering. We demonstrate variational filtering using simulated and real data from hemodynamic systems studied in neuroimaging and provide comparative evaluations using particle filtering and the fixed-form homologue of variational filtering, namely dynamic expectation maximisation.},

	Abstract = {Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for finding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, finding sparse codes remains a very difficult computational problem. In this paper, we present efficient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1-regularized least squares problem and an L2-constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a significant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive field surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1},

Although behavioral studies have demonstrated that these internal models are optimally adapted to the statistics of the environment, the neural underpinning of this adaptation is unknown. Using a Bayesian model of sensory cortical processing, we related stimulus-evoked and spontaneous neural activities to inferences and prior expectations in an internal model and predicted that they should match if the model is statistically optimal. To test this prediction, we analyzed visual cortical activity of awake ferrets during development. Similarity between spontaneous and evoked activities increased with age and was specific to responses evoked by natural scenes. This demonstrates the progressive adaptation of internal models to the statistics of natural stimuli at the neural level.},

	Comment = {* highlights: elegant demonstration showing how by decreasing contrast (that is the signal to noise ratio) the posterior P(features|input, model) of the internal model transforms to the prior P(features|model). Mathematically, there may be a difference in my sense between decreasing contrast and adding noise and there is an underlying hidden hypothesis here of the "noise" in the case of no stimulus. * Fig 2B : decrease of the KL divergence with age * Fig 3 : increase of spatial correlations / decrease of temporal correlations * Fig 4 : "specialisation" of the internal model with age (natural images vs noise vs gratings) shown by a higher KL divergence / clustering * background: largely sits on the shoulder of the sampling hypothesis from the same authors. the argument on the prior which is the average posterior is either a tautology or may refer to some underlying hypothesis mixing the representation of beliefs in neural activity and frequentists measures of the same distribution * minor comments: * the first step of the processing is a thresholding of the MUA rather different from classical spike sorting methods.... is there a reason? correlations in time? transients? Inset S/M in Fig 2C show different levels of average event activity that do not seem to fit to spike activity * they record layer 2/3, thus mainly inhibitory cells? * fig 4b, very strong normalization on the movies (circle at the origin...) * the computation of KL can not be done on the frequntists measures of events (too many problematic zeros), so they go through a fit with a dirichlet distribution. but 1) with rather strong assumptions (alpha=1) and 2) taking the KL of the MAP distirbution instead of the average KL over all possible distributions. 3) missing a normalization term?},

@article{Smith94,
	Abstract = {
                Previous studies have shown that a random-dot kinematogram ({RDK}) comprising dots, each of which takes a random walk in direction or speed over time, can appear to flow in a single direction. This has been interpreted as evidence for the existence of a co-operative network linking neurons sensitive to different directions/speeds and different spatial locations. We have investigated the possibility that global motion perception in such patterns might simply reflect motion energy detection at a coarse spatial scale (such that many dots fall in the receptive field of one energy detector) without the need to encode local dot motions on a fine spatial scale and then integrate their motions over space. We created random-walk {RDKs} and then spatially high-pass filtered them to remove low spatial frequencies. Perception of global motion was unimpaired for both direction and speed random walks, showing that the phenomenon is not reliant on low spatial frequencies and must, therefore, involve integration of local motion signals across space, as originally postulated.

@article{Scarfe10,
	Abstract = {The perceived position of stationary objects can appear shifted in space due to the presence of motion in another part of the visual field (motion drag). We investigated this phenomenon with global motion Gabor arrays. These arrays consist of randomly oriented Gabors (Gaussian windowed sinusoidal luminance modulations) whose speed is set such that the normal component of the individual Gabor's motion is consistent with a single {2D} global velocity. Global motion arrays were shown to alter the perceived position of nearby stationary objects. The size of this shift was the same as that induced by arrays of Gabors uniformly oriented in the direction of global motion and drifting at the global motion speed. Both types of array were found to be robust to large changes in array density and exhibited the same time course of effect. The motion drag induced by the global motion arrays was consistent with the estimated {2D} global velocity, rather than by the component of the local velocities in the global motion direction. This suggests that the motion signal that induces motion drag originates at or after a stage at which local motion signals have been integrated to produce a global motion estimate.},

@article{Britten99a,
	Abstract = {Receptive fields (RFs) of cells in the middle temporal area (MT or V5) of monkeys will often encompass multiple objects under normal image viewing. We therefore have studied how multiple moving stimuli interact when presented within and near the RF of single MT cells. We used moving Gabor function stimuli, <1{degrees} in spatial extent and \~{}100 msec in duration, presented on a grid of possible locations over the RF of the cell. Responses to these stimuli were typically robust, and their small spatial and temporal extent allowed detailed mapping of RFs and of interactions between stimuli. The responses to pairs of such stimuli were compared against the responses to the same stimuli presented singly. The responses were substantially less than the sum of the responses to the component stimuli and were well described by a power-law summation model with divisive inhibition. Such divisive inhibition is a key component of recently proposed "normalization" models of cortical physiology and is presumed to arise from lateral interconnections within a region. One open question is whether the normalization occurs only once in primary visual cortex or multiple times in different cortical areas. We addressed this question by exploring the spatial extent over which one stimulus would divide the response to another and found effective normalization from stimuli quite far removed from the RF center. This supports models under which normalization occurs both in MT and in earlier stages.},

Here, we propose a biologically plausible mechanism for {ICA}-like learning with spiking neurons. Our model combines spike-timing dependent plasticity and synaptic scaling with an intrinsic plasticity rule that regulates neuronal excitability to maximize information transmission. We show that a stochastically spiking neuron learns one independent component for inputs encoded either as rates or using spike-spike correlations. Furthermore, different independent components can be recovered, when the activity of different neurons is decorrelated by adaptive lateral inhibition.},

@article{Xu10,
	Abstract = {Visual saliency is the perceptual quality that makes some items in visual scenes stand out from their immediate contexts. Visual saliency plays important roles in natural vision in that saliency can direct eye movements, deploy attention, and facilitate tasks like object detection and scene understanding. A central unsolved issue is: What features should be encoded in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes? To explore this important issue, we propose a hypothesis that visual saliency is based on efficient encoding of the probability distributions ({PDs}) of visual variables in specific contexts in natural scenes, referred to as context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes. In this concept, computational units in the model of the early visual system do not act as feature detectors but rather as estimators of the context-mediated {PDs} of a full range of visual variables in natural scenes, which directly give rise to a measure of visual saliency of any input stimulus. To test this hypothesis, we developed a model of the context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes using a modified algorithm for independent component analysis ({ICA}) and derived a measure of visual saliency based on these {PDs} estimated from a set of natural scenes. We demonstrated that visual saliency based on the context-mediated {PDs} in natural scenes effectively predicts human gaze in free-viewing of both static and dynamic natural scenes. This study suggests that the computation based on the context-mediated {PDs} of visual variables in natural scenes may underlie the neural mechanism in the early visual cortex for detecting salient features in natural scenes.},

@article{Dyhr10,
	Abstract = {Insect navigational behaviors including obstacle avoidance, grazing landings, and visual odometry are dependent on the ability to estimate flight speed based only on visual cues. In honeybees, this visual estimate of speed is largely independent of both the direction of motion and the spatial frequency content of the image. Electrophysiological recordings from the motion-sensitive cells believed to underlie these behaviors have long supported spatio-temporally tuned correlation-type models of visual motion detection whose speed tuning changes as the spatial frequency of a stimulus is varied. The result is an apparent conflict between behavioral experiments and the electrophysiological and modeling data. In this article, we demonstrate that conventional correlation-type models are sufficient to reproduce some of the speed-dependent behaviors observed in honeybees when square wave gratings are used, contrary to the theoretical predictions. However, these models fail to match the behavioral observations for sinusoidal stimuli. Instead, we show that non-directional motion detectors, which underlie the correlation-based computation of directional motion, can be used to mimic these same behaviors even when narrowband gratings are used. The existence of such non-directional motion detectors is supported both anatomically and electrophysiologically, and they have been hypothesized to be critical in the Dipteran elementary motion detector ({EMD}) circuit.},

What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published <{i>Theory} of Games and Economic Behavior</i>. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other {sciences.<P}>},

	Abstract = {
                Brain processing depends on the interactions between neuronal groups. Those interactions are governed by the pattern of anatomical connections and by yet unknown mechanisms that modulate the effective strength of a given connection. We found that the mutual influence among neuronal groups depends on the phase relation between rhythmic activities within the groups. Phase relations supporting interactions between the groups preceded those interactions by a few milliseconds, consistent with a mechanistic role. These effects were specific in time, frequency, and space, and we therefore propose that the pattern of synchronization flexibly determines the pattern of neuronal interactions.

	Abstract = {Recent work in motor control demonstrates that humans take their own motor uncertainty into account, adjusting the timing and goals of movement so as to maximize expected gain. Visual sensitivity varies dramatically with retinal location and target, and models of optimal visual search typically assume that the visual system takes retinal inhomogeneity into account in planning eye movements. Such models can then use the entire retina rather than just the fovea to speed search. Using a simple decision task, we evaluated human ability to compensate for retinal inhomogeneity. We first measured observers' sensitivity for targets, varying contrast and eccentricity. Observers then repeatedly chose between targets differing in eccentricity and contrast, selecting the one they would prefer to attempt: e.g., a low contrast target at

Observers knew they would later attempt some of their chosen targets and receive rewards for correct classifications. We evaluated performance in three ways. Equivalence : Do observers' judgments agree with their actual performance? Do they correctly trade off eccentricity and contrast and select the more discriminable target in each pair? Transitivity : Are observers' choices self-consistent? Dominance : Do observers understand that increased contrast improves performance? Decreased eccentricity? All observers exhibited patterned failures of equivalence, and seven out of eight observers failed transitivity. There were significant but small failures of dominance. All these failures together reduced their winnings by 10\%\^{a}€ '' 18\%.},

@article{Tetzlaff10,
	Abstract = {Recently evidence has accumulated that many neural networks exhibit self-organized criticality. In this state, activity is similar across temporal scales and this is beneficial with respect to information flow. If subcritical, activity can die out, if supercritical epileptiform patterns may occur. Little is known about how developing networks will reach and stabilize criticality. Here we monitor the development between 13 and 95 days in vitro ({DIV}) of cortical cell cultures ( n = 20) and find four different phases, related to their morphological maturation: An initial low-activity state (\^{a}‰ˆ19 {DIV}) is followed by a supercritical (\^{a}‰ˆ20 {DIV}) and then a subcritical one (\^{a}‰ˆ36 {DIV}) until the network finally reaches stable criticality (\^{a}‰ˆ58 {DIV}). Using network modeling and mathematical analysis we describe the dynamics of the emergent connectivity in such developing systems. Based on physiological observations, the synaptic development in the model is determined by the drive of the neurons to adjust their connectivity for reaching on average firing rate homeostasis. We predict a specific time course for the maturation of inhibition, with strong onset and delayed pruning, and that total synaptic connectivity should be strongly linked to the relative levels of excitation and inhibition. These results demonstrate that the interplay between activity and connectivity guides developing networks into criticality suggesting that this may be a generic and stable state of many networks in vivo and in vitro.},

@article{Fleuriet11,
	Abstract = {When generating a saccade toward a moving target, the target displacement that occurs during the period spanning from its detection to the saccade end must be taken into account to accurately foveate the target and to initiate its pursuit. Previous studies have shown that these saccades are characterized by a lower peak velocity and a prolonged deceleration phase. In some cases, a second peak eye velocity appears during the deceleration phase, presumably reflecting the late influence of a mechanism that compensates for the target displacement occurring before saccade end. The goal of this work was to further determine in the head restrained monkey the dynamics of this putative compensatory mechanism. A step-ramp paradigm, where the target motion was orthogonal to a target step occurring along the primary axes, was used to estimate from the generated saccades: a component induced by the target step and another one induced by the target motion. Resulting oblique saccades were compared with saccades to a static target with matched horizontal and vertical amplitudes. This study permitted to estimate the time taken for visual motion-related signals to update the programming and execution of saccades. The amplitude of the motion-related component was slightly hypometric with an undershoot that increased with target speed. Moreover, it matched with the eccentricity that the target had 40-60 ms before saccade end. The lack of significant difference in the delay between the onsets of the horizontal and vertical components between saccades directed toward a static target and those aimed at a moving target questions the late influence of the compensatory mechanism.

@article{Voges10,
	Abstract = {Most current computational models of neocortical networks assume a homogeneous and isotropic arrangement of local synaptic couplings between neurons. Sparse, recurrent connectivity is typically implemented with simple statistical wiring rules. For spatially extended networks, however, such random graph models are inadequate because they ignore the traits of neuron geometry, most notably various distance dependent features of horizontal connectivity. It is to be expected that such non-random structural attributes have a great impact, both on the spatio-temporal activity dynamics and on the biological function of neocortical networks. Here we review the neuroanatomical literature describing long-range horizontal connectivity in the neocortex over distances of up to eight millimeters, in various cortical areas and mammalian species. We extract the main common features from these data to allow for improved models of large-scale cortical networks. Such models include, next to short-range neighborhood coupling, also long-range patchy connections. We show that despite the large variability in published neuroanatomical data it is reasonable to design a generic model which generalizes over different cortical areas and mammalian species. Later on, we critically discuss this generalization, and we describe some examples of how to specify the model in order to adapt it to specific properties of particular cortical areas or species.},

We use probabilistic models to describe how the low-level visual system could describe superposed and ambiguous information. This allows to describe the interactions of neighboring populations of neurons as inference rules that dynamically build up the overall description of the visual scene. We focus here on temporal prediction, that is by the transport of information based on an estimate of local motion in the image.},

	Abstract = {Neurons display continuous subthreshold oscillations and discrete action potentials ({APs}). When {APs} are phase-locked to the subthreshold oscillation, we hypothesize they represent two types of information: the presence/absence of a sensory feature and the phase of subthreshold oscillation. If subthreshold oscillation phases are neuron-specific, then the sources of {APs} can be recovered based on the {AP} times. If the spatial information about the stimulus is converted to {AP} phases, then {APs} from multiple neurons can be combined into a single axon and the spatial configuration reconstructed elsewhere. For the reconstruction to be successful, we introduce two assumptions: that a subthreshold oscillation field has a constant phase gradient and that coincidences between {APs} and intracellular subthreshold oscillations are neuron-specific as defined by the "interference principle." Under these assumptions, a phase-coding model enables information transfer between structures and reproduces experimental phenomenons such as phase precession, grid cell architecture, and phase modulation of cortical spikes. This article reviews a recently proposed neuronal algorithm for information encoding and decoding from the phase of {APs} (Nadasdy, 2009). The focus is given to the principles common across different systems instead of emphasizing system specific differences.},

	Abstract = { Human perception has recently been characterized as statistical inference based on noisy and ambiguous sensory inputs. Moreover, suitable neural representations of uncertainty have been identified that could underlie such probabilistic computations. In this review, we argue that learning an internal model of the sensory environment is another key aspect of the same statistical inference procedure and thus perception and learning need to be treated jointly. We review evidence for statistically optimal learning in humans and animals, and re-evaluate possible neural representations of uncertainty based on their potential to support statistically optimal learning. We propose that spontaneous activity can have a functional role in such representations leading to a new, sampling-based, framework of how the cortex represents information and uncertainty. },

Although many similarities between spontaneous and sensory-evoked neocortical activity have been reported, little is known about consistent differences between them. Here, using simultaneously recorded cortical populations and morphologically identified pyramidal cells, we compare the laminar structure of spontaneous and sensory-evoked population activity in rat auditory cortex. Spontaneous and evoked patterns both exhibited sparse, spatially localized activity in layer 2/3 pyramidal cells, with densely distributed activity in larger layer 5 pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. However, the propagation of spontaneous and evoked activity differed, with spontaneous activity spreading upward from deep layers and slowly across columns, but sensory responses initiating in presumptive thalamorecipient layers, spreading rapidly across columns. The similarity of sparseness patterns for both neural events and distinct spread of activity may reflect similarity of local processing and differences in the flow of information through cortical circuits, respectively.},

@article{Chalk10,
	Abstract = {Rhythmic activity of neuronal ensembles has been proposed to play an important role in cognitive functions such as attention, perception, and memory. Here we investigate whether rhythmic activity in V1 of the macaque monkey (macaca mulatta) is affected by top-down visual attention. We measured the local field potential ({LFP}) and V1 spiking activity while monkeys performed an attention-demanding detection task. We show that gamma oscillations were strongly modulated by the stimulus and by attention. Stimuli that engaged inhibitory mechanisms induced the largest gamma {LFP} oscillations and the largest spike field coherence. Directing attention toward a visual stimulus at the receptive field of the recorded neurons decreased {LFP} gamma power and gamma spike field coherence. This decrease could reflect an attention-mediated reduction of surround inhibition. Changes in synchrony in V1 would thus be a byproduct of reduced inhibitory drive, rather than a mechanism that directly aids perceptual processing.},

@article{Mitchell09,
	Abstract = { SummaryAttention typically amplifies neuronal responses evoked by task-relevant stimuli while attenuating responses to task-irrelevant distracters. In this context, visual distracters constitute an external source of noise that is diminished to improve attended signal quality. Activity that is internal to the cortex itself, stimulus-independent ongoing correlated fluctuations in firing, might also act as task-irrelevant noise. To examine this, we recorded from area V4 of macaques performing an attention-demanding task. The firing of neurons to identically repeated stimuli was highly variable. Much of this variability originates from ongoing low-frequency (<5 Hz) fluctuations in rate correlated across the neuronal population. When attention is directed to a stimulus inside a neuron's receptive field, these correlated fluctuations in rate are reduced. This attention-dependent reduction of ongoing cortical activity improves the signal-to-noise ratio of pooled neural signals substantially more than attention-dependent increases in firing rate. IntroductionAttention has long been known to improve our ability to detect and discriminate the features of sensory stimuli (James, 1890). One factor that contributes to this improvement in sensory processing is an attention-dependent increase in the mean firing rates of neurons driven by an attended stimulus and associated reductions in the firing rates of neurons driven by task-irrelevant stimuli (for recent reviews, see [Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004] and [Knudsen, 2007]). In addition to mean firing rate, a key factor determining the fidelity of neural signals is response variability. Even under the most controlled stimulus conditions, identically repeated sensory stimuli evoke neural responses that vary from trial to trial ([Softky and Koch, 1993] and [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998]). Response variability affects how reliably information is encoded by neuronal signals ([Parker and Newsome, 1998], [Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen et al., 1996], [Averbeck et al., 2006] and [Pillow et al., 2008]). An attention-dependent reduction in response variability could, therefore, significantly enhance sensory processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli. Consistent with this, the variability of individual neurons is strongly reduced when spatial attention is directed toward the stimulus within the neuron's receptive field (Mitchell et al., 2007).The potential benefits of attention-dependent reductions in response variability depend critically on the degree to which the sources of variability are correlated across the population. Uncorrelated sources of response variability can, in principle, be mitigated by pooling signals across a neural population, with noise approaching zero when signals are pooled over a sufficiently large number of neurons. Thus, if the response variability that is diminished by attention (Mitchell et al., 2007) were independent across neurons, attention-dependent reductions of this variability might yield only a modest improvement in signal quality. This is not the case with variability that is shared across neurons. Such correlated variability cannot be abolished simply by pooling over a large neural population ([Britten et al., 1992] and [Zohary et al., 1994]).Uncorrelated noise, unique to each neuron's response, can arise from variability in synaptic transmission that is amplified by the threshold nonlinearity in spike generation ([Calvin and Stevens, 1967] and [Carandini, 2004]). Correlated activity results from shared inputs ([Moore et al., 1970], [Lytton and Sejnowski, 1991] and [Morita et al., 2008]). Shared variability is evidenced by correlations in firing between pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons. Previous studies have found significant correlations between neurons in visual cortex ([Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998], [Bair et al., 2001] and [Kohn and Smith, 2005]). Correlations are not limited to local populations but persist even between neurons separated as much as 10 mm in cortex ([Smith and Kohn, 2008] and [Nauhaus et al., 2009]). Thus, fluctuations may be shared over very large neuronal populations including many thousands of cells. Because they are shared among many neurons, correlated fluctuations quickly would dominate as the source of noise in pooled measures of neuronal activity (Chen et al., 2006) and, depending on how information is read-out from populations, could impose severe limits on the accuracy of information represented (Zohary et al., 1994). It is thus important to determine whether attention decorrelates response variability that is shared across the population. ResultsWe recorded the responses of neurons in area V4, an intermediate stage of visual processing that has previously been found to be modulated by attention, in two macaques as they performed the attention-demanding tracking task depicted in Figure 1. Using this task, we could direct attention toward or away from a stimulus that we positioned within the neurons' receptive fields (Figure 1). We presented the same visual stimulus on all trials, providing a large number of identical stimulus repetitions from which to estimate variability in the neuronal response. On each trial, the stimulus paused and remained within the region of receptive field overlap for a period of 1000 ms, enabling us to estimate fluctuations in firing rate over a relatively long time period. Because the stimulus was constant during this period, the variability in firing reflects response fluctuations internal to cortex rather than stimulus-induced variability. As previously reported (Mitchell et al., 2007), we find that the spiking response of individual neurons was highly variable to repeated stimuli and that attention reduces this variability. This is illustrated in Figure 2, which shows the responses of a single V4 neuron to 48 presentations of the identical stimulus. This neuron exhibited a robust response to the stimulus, which persisted through the pause period, until the stimulus left the receptive field. The raster plot at the top of the figure shows the neuron's response to this stimulus, on trials sorted according to whether attention was directed toward the stimulus in the receptive field ( '' Attended,'' top) or was instead directed away from the receptive field ( '' Ignored,'' middle). The left vertical yellow line indicates when the stimulus paused after entering the receptive field. The right yellow line shows the end of the 1000 ms pause period, when the stimulus initiated movement out of the receptive field. We characterized neuronal response variability with reference to the variability expected of a Poisson process, in which each spike occurs with a fixed probability that is independent of the neuron's spiking history. For a homogenous Poisson process, the variance of the number of spikes within a fixed time interval is equal to the mean spike count in that interval. The Fano factor (F), the ratio of spike count variance to mean spike count, is therefore 1 for a Poisson process. We computed the Fano factor in each of the attention conditions, over 100 ms time windows. As shown in the lower panel, Fano factor tended to be >1 for unattended responses (shown in blue), indicating response variability greater than would be expected for a Poisson process. We focused our analysis on the last 800 ms of the sustained period, during which the firing rate was relatively stable and free of response transients due to the stimulus entering the receptive field. When attention was directed into the receptive field, the Fano factor was significantly reduced (permutation test, p < 0.0001). Across the 191 neurons, there was a significant median reduction of Fano factor of 8.8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

(Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001) with 42 units showing individually significant modulation (p < 0.05, permutation test), all of which were reductions (see population average in Figure 5A).We examined whether this response variability reflected independent fluctuations in the responses of individual neurons or instead represents a source of correlated noise that is shared across the network. To assess this, we undertook two types of analyses. First, we computed the coherence between spikes from pairs of separate isolated units recorded simultaneously in the same session. The spike-to-spike coherence provides a frequency-resolved measure of the degree to which fluctuations in spiking in one unit are correlated with fluctuations in spiking of a second neuron. It is sensitive only to fluctuations in firing rate that occur within the duration of a single trial (<800 ms). The spike-to-spike coherence is shown in Figure 3A, for the same unit presented in Figure 2 paired with a simultaneously recorded neuron. The upper line, blue, shows the coherence

SEM) when attention was directed away from the stimulus in the neuron's receptive field. The red line shows coherence with attention directed into the receptive field. In order to show the level of coherence that would be expected by chance, we randomly shuffled the trial-by-trial records of the second unit and computed coherence between the resulting random permutations of spiking responses (dashed lines). The attended and unattended coherence values both exceeded the level to be expected by chance across frequencies below 5 Hz, coinciding with the strong peak in the coherence. This indicates that attention reduced the degree to which low-frequency fluctuations in the neuron's spiking were correlated with fluctuations in the activity of the other neuron. We find that this attention-dependent reduction in low-frequency coherence was common across our recordings. We measured the percentage change in coherence at the peak below 5 Hz for each pair. Across 236 neuron pairs (69 recorded on a single electrode, 167 recorded on separate electrodes), there was a median percentage reduction of 22.6\%, and overall values were significantly reduced (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p < 0.0001). Among the 18 pairs that showed individually significant changes in coherence over frequencies <5 Hz, all exhibited reductions. A reduction in low-frequency correlated activity is also evident in the data shown in Figure 3B, which shows correlations in spike counts for the neuronal pair used to compute the coherence in 3A. Correlation coefficients were computed based on the spike counts of the two neurons across trials in simultaneous counting intervals. The upper line (blue) was derived from data recorded when attention was directed away from the receptive field, the lower line (red) from trials when attention was directed into the receptive field. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that response variability is correlated across neurons ([Zohary et al., 1994], [Bair et al., 2001], [Lampl et al., 1999], [Kohn and Smith, 2005], [Smith and Kohn, 2008], [Jermakowicz et al., 2009] and [Huang and Lisberger, 2009]), as indicated by values above zero (horizontal black line). To assess the time scale of correlations, we computed correlations using different sized counting windows ([Bair et al., 2001] and [Smith and Kohn, 2008]). Consistent with these studies, we find that the correlation coefficient grows larger with counting interval, indicating that correlations predominantly reflect low-frequency rate fluctuations. The correlations were reduced when attention was directed into the receptive field.The average spike-to-spike coherence across all 236 neuron pairs (175 recorded from monkey M and 61 from monkey B) is shown in Figure 4A for attended (red) and unattended (blue) trials. Consistent with the individual neurons whose responses are shown in Figure 3, we find that the coherence in spiking is significantly reduced over frequencies below 20 Hz when attention is directed into the neuronal receptive field. Consistent with the pair of neurons shown in Figure 3, the strongest reductions were found below 5 Hz, for both monkeys (monkey M, 175 pairs: median reduction 26.5\%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001; monkey B, 61 pairs: median reduction 14.3\%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.05). Consistent with this low-frequency coherence, the average correlation in spiking between pairs increases with longer timescales, as seen in Figure 4B. We find that correlations in spiking averaged between counting windows from 30 to 300 ms are significantly reduced with attention directed into the receptive field in one monkey and marginally reduced in a second animal that had fewer pairs (monkey M, 175 pairs: median reduction 39.3\%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p < 0.0001; monkey B, 61 pairs: median reduction 49.9\%, Wilcoxon sign rank test, p = 0.062). The distribution of correlations for attended and ignored conditions is shown for a single counting window of 100 ms in Figure 4C for the two animals (monkey M in green, monkey B in black). Whereas coherence is computed within trials, correlation is computed from spike counts across different trials. Therefore, correlation is potentially sensitive not only to fluctuations occurring within a trial but also to fluctuations on much longer timescales that span multiple trial epochs. However, across our population, we find that correlation saturates near 100 ms (Figure 4B), and further, there is little effect when we factor out changes in rate that occur over intervals longer than 800 ms (see Experimental Procedures). This is consistent with earlier studies that have reported correlations between pairs of neurons that saturate at counting windows around 30--300 ms ([Bair et al., 2001] and [Smith and Kohn, 2008]). We analyzed separately the 69 neuron pairs that were recorded on a single electrode and the 167 pairs that were recorded on separate electrodes. Both sets showed significant reductions in correlation and coherence with attention (see Figure S1).Previous studies have suggested that correlations in firing severely limit the quality of information represented by neuronal populations ([Zohary et al., 1994] and [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998]). We evaluated how these attention-dependent reductions in correlated firing might impact the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of pooled neuronal signals (Figure 4D). If neuronal fluctuations were uncorrelated, then their impact could be diminished to any desired extent by pooling over a sufficiently large population of neurons, resulting in an arbitrarily large SNR (black line). Correlations limit the benefit of pooling by imposing an upper asymptote on SNR as a function of the size of the neuronal pool. To quantify the potential limits imposed by the degree of correlations we observed in our unattended responses, we calculated SNR as a function of the number of neurons in the pool, assuming the mean level of correlation we observed in our unattended trials (r = 0.068 at a counting window of 100 ms). This leads to the level of saturation in the SNR shown in the blue line (see Zohary et al., 1994, Figure 3 for details). To measure the benefits of attention-dependent reductions in correlated firing, we repeated the calculation using the mean correlation we observed on attended trials (r = 0.034 at 100 ms windows). This resulted in a 39\% improvement in the asymptotic SNR (red line).We next compared this to the improvement attributable to attention-dependent increases in firing rate. In line with previous studies finding that attention increases responses (Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004) we find that attention increased firing rate by an average of 20\%. This increase in rate, with no corresponding change in correlations of firing, would cause only a 9.5\% change in the SNR (orange line). Thus, given the simplest pooling strategy, the observed reductions in correlated firing would improve signal quality by more than four times the improvement attributable to attention-dependent increases in firing rate.Next, we quantified the time course of attention-dependent reductions in correlation and coherence. Figure 5 shows the results of this analysis. Figure 5A shows the Fano factor for attended stimuli (red line) and unattended stimuli (blue line), averaged over the population. The vertical yellow lines show the pause period. As reported earlier (Mitchell et al., 2007), attention significantly reduced individual neuron's response variability, as measured by the Fano factor during last 800 ms of the pause period. Panels (B)--(G) show correlations and coherence computed across successive 400 ms time windows centered on the early, middle, and late parts of the pause period. The first of these windows began 200 ms before the stimulus paused, so it covered the initial response that occurred as the stimulus swept into the receptive field. As noted earlier (Mitchell et al., 2007), the Fano factor in both attention conditions is reduced during this initial response period. This is consistent with a recent meta-analysis finding reductions in Fano factor in many brain areas during the transient response that follows stimulus onset (M. Churchland et al., 2009, Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, conference abstract 92). The second and third windows cover the next two successive 400 ms periods, which together constitute the 800 ms sustained period analyzed in Figure 3 and Figure 4. These two windows each showed clear correlation that was significantly reduced by attention. Panels (B) and (E) show that correlations and coherence are reduced in this early period, as compared to the later sustained period (panels C and D, F and G). Even though the overall Fano factor, correlations, and coherence during the early period were reduced relative to the later sustained response that was the focus of our study, the correlation in the early period was still significantly reduced by attention. Thus, while it is stronger during the sustained response, the attention-dependent reduction in correlation holds throughout the stimulus-evoked response.We next considered if small fixational eye movements present during task performance could contribute to the correlations in firing and corresponding attention-dependent reductions. Because eye movements displace the stimulus on the retina, they can act as an external source of stimulus-induced variability for visual neurons. Fixational eye movements have been shown to increase the variability of individual neuron's firing in primary visual cortex ([Gur et al., 1997], [Gur et al., 1999] and [Gur and Snodderly, 2006]), and a previous study in visual area V4 also indicates that modulations in rate due to eye movements can be substantial (Leopold and Logothetis, 1998). Another study, however, found small eye movements could not account for the slow timescale correlations observed in extrastriate area MT in perceptual decision tasks (Bair and O'Keefe, 1998). Previously, we examined the data set reported here to determine if fixational eye movements contribute to the attention-dependent changes in individual neuronal response variability (Mitchell et al., 2007; Figure S7). We found that fixational eye movements produced a measurable modulation of firing rate, but that it was very small, giving less than a 5\% modulation of rate during the 400 ms following movements. Removing the 400 ms periods following the detected eye movements from analysis had no appreciable effect on the Fano factor. We applied this same method to detect fixational eye movements in the current study and removed the 400 ms periods following eye movements in recalculating the spike-to-spike coherence and the spike count correlations between neuronal pairs. Similar to our previous report on the Fano factor, here we find that fixational eye movements have no appreciable effect on either of our estimates of correlated activity (correlation or coherence) (see Figures S2A and S2B). We therefore conclude that the low-frequency variability we observed, and its reduction by attention, does not arise from fixational eye movements. DiscussionThe present findings reveal that spatially selective attention acts to reduce task-irrelevant correlated noise. The source of noise originates from slow to intermediate timescale fluctuations in firing rate that are correlated across relatively large populations of neurons. The timescale and spatial spread of the correlations resembles that reported in earlier studies, where the variability in firing of single units was found to significantly influence behavioral variability ([Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998] and [Bair et al., 2001]). These earlier studies show that, depending on how information is decoded from populations, correlated noise can impose severe limits on the accuracy of information represented (Zohary et al., 1994). Similar theoretical analyses indicated that the attention-dependent reductions in correlated firing observed in the current study would produce much greater improvements in signal-to-noise ratio than the increases in firing rate associated with attention. Relationship to Previous Studies of Response VariabilitySlow correlated fluctuations in rate are common in cortical activity under a wide variety of stimulus and arousal conditions. Studies using voltage-sensitive dyes have imaged activity across large areas of cortex in anesthetized rats and cats. These studies find that in both spontaneous and stimulus evoked conditions there are stochastic waves of activity that propagate slowly across cortex ([Arieli et al., 1996], [Kenet et al., 2003] and [Han et al., 2008]). This type of correlated firing produces correlations that are spatially and temporally extended. Recent studies using similar imaging techniques in awake macaques ([Chen et al., 2006] and [Chen et al., 2008]) and recording from large electrode arrays in the anesthetized macaques ([Kohn and Smith, 2005] and [Smith and Kohn, 2008]) find similar correlations in noise. The correlation values we observe are similar to those reported in earlier studies ([Zohary et al., 1994], [Shadlen and Newsome, 1998] and [Bair et al., 2001]).We have shown that for a simple model of response pooling the observed reductions in correlated firing would substantially improve the signal-to-noise ratio for attended signals. The exact degree of improvement will critically depend on the pooling strategy employed by cortex and could even favor using correlations to represent signals if they could be isolated from noise (Abbott and Dayan, 1999). For example, (Chen et al., 2006) and (Chen et al., 2008) have shown that slow fluctuations in rate could be largely eliminated from subsequent stages of processing using a center-surround antagonism in space combined with temporal differencing in time, filtering parts of the signal that are more corrupted by noise ([Chen et al., 2006] and [Chen et al., 2008]). However, Chen and colleagues find that highly trained macaques do not achieve this theoretical performance, suggesting that the noise is either not fully eliminated or that there are as yet other unidentified sources of noise that corrupt perceptual decisions. Further studies will be critical in linking behavioral variability to sources of internal variability to determine the read-out strategy.Recent research in primary visual cortex has analyzed the temporal and spatial structure of correlated firing. Smith and Kohn (2008) recorded simultaneously from an extended region of primary visual cortex using a Utah array. These arrays penetrate the superficial layers of cortex and therefore preferentially sample neuronal activity from layers II/III. They found that precise spike synchrony on the order of a few milliseconds is limited in spatial extent, suggesting that it results from common feedforward thalamocortical axons extending over short distances (<1 mm) within layer IV (Blasdel and Lund, 1983). In contrast, lower frequency rate fluctuations are correlated over at least 10 mm, possibly reflecting recurrent horizontal connections (which extend over distances of 6 mm [Gilbert and Wiesel, 1983]) or feedback connections from extrastriate cortex which extend over >10 mm ([Angelucci et al., 2002] and [Shmuel et al., 2005]). Related experiments in cat and monkey V1 using the Utah array found additional evidence that low-frequency rate fluctuations result, at least in part, from activity propagated by long-range horizontal connections. Nauhaus et al. (2009) used spikes recorded on one electrode to compute spike-triggered local field potentials (LFPs) measured at different distances from the triggering spike. These became progressively delayed with distance, corresponding to a propagation of activity emanating from the spiking neuron at a velocity of 0.3 m/s, which matches the propagation velocity of long-range horizontal connections in superficial layers (II-III) of cat primary visual cortex (Hirsch and Gilbert, 1991). The waves observed by Nauhaus et al. were most prominent among recording sites with neurons that shared orientation preference. Long-range layer II/III axons connect neurons with shared response preferences. This, coupled with the fact that the arrays record preferentially from superficial layers, suggests that the waves are conveyed by layer II/III neurons. During spontaneous activity, these waves of activity propagated over the entire extent of the 10 mm grid, consistent in spatial scale with the low-frequency rate fluctuations recorded by Smith and Kohn (2008). The spatial scale and magnitude of these waves were reduced when Nauhaus and colleagues presented a visual stimulus, and this reduction became more pronounced with elevation of stimulus contrast. Taken together, these findings suggest that a prominent source of low-frequency correlated response variability is the ongoing activity that is propagated within a cortical area by layer II/III long-range horizontal connections. Further, these fluctuations in activity are reduced in size and spatial extent by increases in stimulus drive. Relationship to Previous Studies of AttentionPrevious studies have reported that attention increases correlations among local populations of neurons ([Fries et al., 2001] and [Gregoriou et al., 2009]; for a recent review, see Womelsdorf and Fries, 2007). These studies have emphasized increases in gamma frequency synchronization, but they have also found reductions in low-frequency spike-field coherence (SFC). The present results suggest that this reduction in low-frequency SFC may reflect attention-dependent reductions in low-frequency correlated rate fluctuations.Cohen and Newsome (2008) recently found another way in which noise correlations vary with attentional state. In their study, they recorded from pairs of MT neurons in monkeys performing a direction discrimination task. On some trials, one of the two motions to be distinguished was chosen to be preferred by both neurons and the other was nonpreferred. On other trials, the motion axis was rotated so that one of the two motions to be distinguished was preferred by one neuron and the other direction was preferred by the other neuron. Interneuronal correlations were significantly stronger when in the former condition, where the two neurons favored the same motion choice. They were able to reproduce their findings using a simple model in which feature-based attention sometimes alternated between the two directions being discriminated. According to this model, firing rates of both neurons were elevated when feature-based attention favored both neurons' preferred direction, and their rates were reduced when attention was directed to their nonpreferred direction, thereby increasing correlation. The present experiments are in no way incompatible with the findings of Cohen and Newsome. However, they suggest that a different mechanism is at work under our task and sensory conditions. First, the tasks were very different from one another. Cohen and Newsome held spatial attention constant while varying feature-based attention by requiring the animal to discriminate between motions that fell along one of two different motion axes. Our task did not vary feature-based attention. Monkeys simply attentively tracked target stimuli among distracters that were identical to targets except in spatial location, and the two conditions we compared differed only in whether spatial attention was directed into the receptive field or not. Second, the correlations observed by Cohen and Newsome depended on whether the features preferred by the two neurons under study fell along the axis of motion to be discriminated or across that axis. In our experiment, we used stimuli that were, to the extent possible, preferred by all neurons under study. Possible Neural MechanismsWe previously found that attention reduces individual neurons' variability (Mitchell et al., 2007). That finding could potentially have been explained using a model in which attention dampens response fluctuations that stem from processes internal to individual neurons. For example, many neurons exhibit burst spiking in which they fire doublets or triplets of action potentials. This represents a very fast type of rate fluctuation that is largely determined by the ionic channels involved in spike generation (Brumberg et al., 2000). The mechanisms governing burst generation can be altered by neuromodulators such as acetylcholine (Wang and McCormick, 1993) and would thus influence the variability of spiking of individual neurons. The present data show that the variation in firing rate that is reduced by attention is at least in part correlated across neurons, not simply dampened in individual neurons.What neural mechanisms might account for this attention-dependent reduction in correlated response variability? One possible answer is suggested by models that have recently been developed to account for the spontaneous emergence of low-frequency correlated rate fluctuations (Yanagawa and Mogi, 2009; K. Rajan, L.F. Abbott, and H. Sompolinsky, personal communication). Of particular relevance, Rajan et al. (K. Rajan et al., personal communication) have shown that spontaneously generated fluctuations can be reduced by introduction of a stimulus input. In their model, the introduction of a stimulus results in a shift in the competition between stimulus-driven activity and the intrinsic response variability that emerges from the propagation of spontaneous activity within the cortical circuit. This is consistent with observations made in anesthetized animals ([Lampl et al., 1999], [Kohn and Smith, 2005], [Smith and Kohn, 2008], [Jermakowicz et al., 2009] and [Nauhaus et al., 2009]). Several models of attention have proposed that attention either directly scales neuronal firing rates (McAdams and Maunsell, 1999) or scales the inputs to a normalization circuit ([Reynolds et al., 1999], [Reynolds and Chelazzi, 2004], [Ghose and Maunsell, 2008], [Reynolds and Heeger, 2009] and [Lee and Maunsell, 2009]). These ideas can be combined to provide an explanation for the present observation that attention reduces correlated rate fluctuations. If attention increases stimulus drive, this could, like introducing a bottom-up stimulus, bias responses in favor of the stimulus drive, thereby suppressing intrinsic response variability. That is, attention-dependent reductions in response variability may be a simple consequence of attention-dependent increases in stimulus drive. In this view, when attention is directed to a stimulus, this diminishes the impact of spontaneously fluctuating network activity, reducing individual neurons' response variability and reducing low-frequency correlated rate fluctuations.

spacing) at 60 Hz. Stimuli were presented on a computer monitor (Sony Trinitron Multiscan, TC, 640 × 480 pixel resolution, 120 Hz) placed 57 cm from the eye. Once the receptive field and preferred stimulus were determined, the neuron was recorded as a preferred stimulus (40\\ luminance contrast) was placed inside the receptive field during the performance of an attention-demanding task that is described shortly. When more than a single neuron could be isolated simultaneously, the stimulus was positioned within the region of receptive field overlap, and the orientation and color of the stimulus were selected to match the neuron with the most robust response. During mapping and the main task, eye position was continuously monitored with an infrared eye tracking system (240 Hz, ETL-400; ISCAN, Inc.). Stimulus presentation and reward delivery were handled by Cortex software (http://www.cortex.salk.edu/). Behavioral TaskIn each trial of the main task, either a tracked (attended) or distracter (unattended) stimulus was brought inside the receptive field and remained there for a sustained pause of 1000 ms. Two monkeys were trained to perform a multiple-object tracking task that has been used to study attention in human psychophysics ([Pylyshyn and Storm, 1988], [Sears and Pylyshyn, 2000] and [Cavanagh and Alvarez, 2005]). Each trial began with the monkey fixating a central point followed by the appearance of four identical Gabor stimuli, each of preferred color and orientation, and spaced equally on a ring of equal eccentricity. Then a subset of the stimuli (either one or two) was cued by a brief luminance flash and one of a set of eight different movie trajectories (generated random each day) repositioned the stimuli at a new set of equally eccentric locations. During this repositioning of stimuli, a single stimulus was brought inside the neuron's receptive field. The stimulus remained in the receptive field for a 1000 ms pause, and then all stimuli were repositioned again to another set of equally eccentric positions. The monkey maintained fixation on the central point throughout the trial and then at the end reported which stimuli were originally cued by making a saccade to their locations.Stimulus trajectories were constrained to match sensory conditions between attended and unattended trials. No stimulus fell inside the neuron's receptive before the designated pause period. The set of trajectories were balanced so the starting and ending locations for any stimulus could not be predicted from its pause location. To ensure spatial symmetry in where attended stimuli were located during the pause, all subsets of stimuli were cued an equal number of times. Only correctly completed trials with two of four stimuli being tracked were included in analysis with each set of trajectories being included an equal number of times. This gives 40 trials on average per attention condition. Inclusion Criteria and Data AnalysisThe attention-dependent changes in neuronal spiking were examined only in those neurons that had a significant visually evoked response (N = 191). The visual response was considered significant if the mean visual response was greater than 5 Hz in the last 500 ms of the pause period and was significantly greater than the firing rate in the 500 ms directly after cueing when no stimulus was inside the receptive field (Mann-Whitney U test, p < 0.05). A minimum response of 5 Hz was needed in order to accurately characterize the variability in spiking. In the total population, 174 of 365 neurons were excluded due to low visually evoked responses. For paired responses of two neurons, we required that both neurons have significant evoked visual responses and that the square root of the product of their rates be at least 5 Hz. In the total population, 151 of 387 pairs were excluded due to low firing rates.Trial-to-trial variability was estimated by the Fano factor, the ratio of the variance of the spike counts across trials divided by the mean of the spike counts. Analysis was restricted to the last 800 ms of the pause period when mean firing rate was relatively stable. We used a counting window of size 100 ms to compute spike counts in the Fano factor analysis. We computed the mean and variance for each 100 ms nonoverlapping window over the course of the trial. To assess the effect of attention we pooled the results to give a single value for the last 800 ms of the sustained period when firing rate was relatively stable. Statistical significance was assessed by permutation tests between the attended and unattended trials.We examined the degree to which neuronal firing is correlated between pairs of units in two ways. First, we computed the coherence between two spiking signals using multitaper methods ([Mitra and Pesaran, 1999], [Jarvis and Mitra, 2001] and [Pesaran et al., 2002]). The 800 ms sustained period was broken into several intervals of 400 ms, stepping 200 ms to cover the full period. The DC component of each spike train was removed, and tapered with a single Slepian taper, giving an effective smoothing of 2.5 Hz for the 400 ms data windows (NW = 1, K = 1). Confidence intervals were evaluated using the jack knife procedure by leaving out individual trials. To evaluate if time-locked trends in firing rate across the trial contributed to coherence estimates, we performed several random shuffles of the trial identities and recomputed the coherence. This provides a baseline for the coherence expected solely due to trends in firing time-locked to the trial. Coherence is computed from cross-correlations within trials, and then cross-correlations are pooled over trials and normalized by the power spectra of spike trains, also pooled over trials. Because the cross-correlations are computed within trials, coherence is only sensitive to fluctuations in firing rate captured within the relatively short interval of the trial (<800 ms).We also examined the correlations in firing between pairs of units during the last 800 ms of the sustained period. Previous studies of correlated firing in cortex ([Bair et al., 2001], [Kohn and Smith, 2005] and [Smith and Kohn, 2008]) have assessed the temporal scale of rate fluctuations by computing the correlation for several different counting windows. We computed the Pearson correlation for counting intervals that spanned the last 800 ms of the pause period (6, 9, 12, 17, 25, 35, 50, 71, 100, 141, 200, 283, 400, and 800 ms). When the correlation is computed in counting bins smaller than the sustained period of 800 ms, the total trial epoch is divided into bins (for example, there would be eight bins of 100 ms duration) and the mean in each bin for each neuron is subtracted out prior to computing correlations between different neurons. This eliminates any consistent changes in firing rate that are time locked to trial events, such as the response onset to the stimulus entering the receptive field.Because the correlation is measured from spike counts across different trials, it is sensitive not only to fluctuations in rate that occur within trials, as is the case for the coherence measure, but also to trends in firing rate on much longer time scales that span trials. There are several reasons that firing rate might drift over long timescales in an experiment, including changes in alertness of the animal or even health of the tissue being recorded. If these trends were shared across neurons, they would contribute to the overall correlations measured. Previous studies have addressed these long time scale trends by subtracting out the mean firing rate smoothed over several trials prior to computing correlations on spike counts ([Bair et al., 2001] and [Cohen and Newsome, 2008]). Therefore, in our analysis of correlation we also subtracted out slow trends in firing rate for each unit. The mean firing rate during the pause period was averaged over adjacent trials using a Gaussian smoothing window with a width of σ = 5 trials. This smoothed firing rate was then subtracted from the spike counts of each trial to give normalized spike counts, which were used in computing correlation. Again, confidence intervals were evaluated using the jack knife procedure by leaving out individual trials.We found that subtracting out the smoothed firing rate had very little effect on the overall correlations observed in the population. In Figure S3, the correlations are shown as square symbols when no smoothing is employed, superimposed over the correlations computed with smoothing (shown by lines). This indicates that fluctuations on very long timescales spanning trials did not contribute significantly to our results.The magnitude of coherence estimates and estimates of correlation between spike counts critically depends on the number of spikes used to create the estimate (Zeitler et al., 2006; J. Curtis et al., 2009, Frontiers in Systems Neuroscience, conference abstract 138). See also Figures S4--S6. To control for differences in firing rate, we threw out randomly chosen sets of spikes from the attention condition with the higher firing rate for each individual unit in order to equate the total number of spikes in each condition. This procedure was repeated 20 times, each time throwing out a different random sample to equate the firing rates, and the results from the random samples were averaged both for coherence and correlation analyses. This reduces bias introduced by the rate-dependence in the correlation and coherence measures; however, our results remained qualitatively similar without any rate matching.

	Abstract = {The nucleus basalis of the basal forebrain is an essential component of the neuromodulatory system controlling the behavioral state of an animal and it is thought to be important in regulating arousal and attention. However, the effect of nucleus basalis activation on sensory processing remains poorly understood. Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis-induced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding.},

	Abstract = {In crowded visual scenes, attention is needed to select relevant stimuli. To study the underlying mechanisms, we recorded neurons in cortical area V4 while macaque monkeys attended to behaviorally relevant stimuli and ignored distracters. Neurons activated by the attended stimulus showed increased gamma-frequency (35 to 90 hertz) synchronization but reduced low-frequency (<17 hertz) synchronization compared with neurons at nearby V4 sites activated by distracters. Because postsynaptic integration times are short, these localized changes in synchronization may serve to amplify behaviorally relevant signals in the cortex.},

@article{Tlapale10,
	Abstract = {The dynamics of motion integration show striking similarities when observed at neuronal, psychophysical, and oculomotor levels. Based on the inter-relation and complementary insights given by those dynamics, our goal was to test how basic mechanisms of dynamical cortical processing can be incorporated in a dynamical model to solve several aspects of {2D} motion integration and segmentation. Our model is inspired by the hierarchical processing stages of the primate visual cortex: we describe the interactions between several layers processing local motion and form information through feedforward, feedback, and inhibitive lateral connections. Also, following perceptual studies concerning contour integration and physiological studies of receptive fields, we postulate that motion estimation takes advantage of another low-level cue, which is luminance smoothness along edges or surfaces, in order to gate recurrent motion diffusion. With such a model, we successfully reproduced the temporal dynamics of motion integration on a wide range of simple motion stimuli: line segments, rotating ellipses, plaids, and barber poles. Furthermore, we showed that the proposed computational rule of luminance-gated diffusion of motion information is sufficient to explain a large set of contextual modulations of motion integration and segmentation in more elaborated stimuli such as chopstick illusions, simulated aperture problems, or rotating diamonds. As a whole, in this paper we proposed a new basal luminance-driven motion integration mechanism as an alternative to less parsimonious models, we carefully investigated the dynamics of motion integration, and we established a distinction between simple and complex stimuli according to the kind of information required to solve their ambiguities.},

@article{Verghese06,
	Abstract = {Discriminating between two speed signals is harder when they are seen as part of a single trajectory, compared to the case when they appear as distinct entities. Observers were asked to judge which half of a display had dots that were moving faster. This was done under two main conditions: when dot motion appeared to continue across the boundary between the two halves, and when it moved parallel to the boundary. Speed discrimination thresholds were elevated when motion in the two halves appeared to cross the boundary compared to the case when motion was parallel to the boundary. Extensive practice improved performance until speed discrimination in the two cases was virtually indistinguishable. The addition of noise caused the original effect to reappear, i.e., thresholds were elevated when motion continued across the border. Our results suggest that the local differences in velocity on either side of border are ignored when motion appears to cross the border. Instead the visual system seems to enforce an a priori assumption that when motion continues across a boundary it belongs to a common motion path.},

	Abstract = {Invariant representations of stimulus features are thought to play an important role in producing stable percepts of objects. In the present study, we assess the invariance of neural representations of tactile motion direction with respect to other stimulus properties. To this end, we record the responses evoked in individual neurons in somatosensory cortex of primates, including areas 3b, 1, and 2, by three types of motion stimuli, namely scanned bars and dot patterns, and random dot displays, presented to the fingertips of macaque monkeys. We identify a population of neurons in area 1 that is highly sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion and whose motion signals are invariant across stimulus types and conditions. The motion signals conveyed by individual neurons in area 1 can account for the ability of human observers to discriminate the direction of motion of these stimuli, as measured in paired psychophysical experiments. We conclude that area 1 contains a robust representation of motion and discuss similarities in the neural mechanisms of visual and tactile motion processing.},

@article{Boloori10,
	Abstract = {During behavior, rats and other rodents use their facial vibrissae to actively explore surfaces through whisking and head/body movement, resulting in complex sensory inputs that vary over a large range of angular velocities and temporal scales. How these complex sensory inputs manifest in the patterns of cortical firing events that ultimately form the perceptual experience is not well understood. Through single-unit cortical recordings of layer 4 neurons in S1 of the anesthetized rat, we systematically quantified the interactions between instantaneous velocity and timing of vibrissa motion, finding a strong interaction between angular velocity and timing of contacts on the tens of milliseconds time scale. From the quantification of these joint tuning properties, a detailed nonlinear encoding model was formulated that was highly predictive of firing probability and timing characteristics of the sparse cortical representation of complex patterned tactile inputs. Within a Bayesian framework, the encoding model was then used to decode tactile patterns under simple transformations of the stimulus along dimensions of velocity and timing, as a demonstration of the lower bound of the idealized perceptual capabilities of the animal.},

@article{Klampfl10,
	Abstract = {Neurons in the brain are able to detect and discriminate salient spatiotemporal patterns in the firing activity of presynaptic neurons. It is open how they can learn to achieve this, especially without the help of a supervisor. We show that a well-known unsupervised learning algorithm for linear neurons, slow feature analysis ({SFA}), is able to acquire the discrimination capability of one of the best algorithms for supervised linear discrimination learning, the Fisher linear discriminant ({FLD}), given suitable input statistics. We demonstrate the power of this principle by showing that it enables readout neurons from simulated cortical microcircuits to learn without any supervision to discriminate between spoken digits and to detect repeated firing patterns that are embedded into a stream of noise spike trains with the same firing statistics. Both these computer simulations and our theoretical analysis show that slow feature extraction enables neurons to extract and collect information that is spread out over a trajectory of firing states that lasts several hundred ms. In addition, it enables neurons to learn without supervision to keep track of time (relative to a stimulus onset, or the initiation of a motor response). Hence, these results elucidate how the brain could compute with trajectories of firing states rather than only with fixed point attractors. It also provides a theoretical basis for understanding recent experimental results on the emergence of view- and position-invariant classification of visual objects in inferior temporal cortex.},

@article{Shamir10,
	Abstract = {The increasing prevalence of automated image acquisition systems is enabling new types of microscopy experiments that generate large image datasets. However, there is a perceived lack of robust image analysis systems required to process these diverse datasets. Most automated image analysis systems are tailored for specific types of microscopy, contrast methods, probes, and even cell types. This imposes significant constraints on experimental design, limiting their application to the narrow set of imaging methods for which they were designed. One of the approaches to address these limitations is pattern recognition, which was originally developed for remote sensing, and is increasingly being applied to the biology domain. This approach relies on training a computer to recognize patterns in images rather than developing algorithms or tuning parameters for specific image processing tasks. The generality of this approach promises to enable data mining in extensive image repositories, and provide objective and quantitative imaging assays for routine use. Here, we provide a brief overview of the technologies behind pattern recognition and its use in computer vision for biological and biomedical imaging. We list available software tools that can be used by biologists and suggest practical experimental considerations to make the best use of pattern recognition techniques for imaging assays.},

@article{Watamaniuk95,
	Abstract = {Human observers can easily detect a signal dot moving, in apparent motion, on a trajectory embedded in a background of random-direction motion noise. A high detection rate is possible even though the spatial and temporal characteristics (step size and frame rate) of the signal are identical to the noise, making the signal indistinguishable from the noise on the basis of a single pair of frames. The success rate for detecting the signal dot was as high as 90\% when the probability of mismatch from frame-to-frame, based on nearest-neighbor matching, was 0.3. Control experiments showed that trajectory detection is not based on detecting a "string" of collinear dots, i.e. a stationary position cue. Nor is a trajectory detected because it produces stronger signals in single independent motion detectors. For one thing, trajectory detection improves with increases in duration, up to 250-400 msec, a duration longer than the integration typically associated with a single motion detector. For another, the signal dot need not travel in a straight line to be detectable. The signal dot was as reliably detected when it changed its direction a small amount (about 30 deg or less) each frame. Consistent with this, circular paths of sufficiently low curvature were as detectable as straight trajectories. Our data suggest that trajectory motion is highly detectable in motion noise because the component local motion signals are enhanced when motion detectors with similar directional tuning are stimulated in a sequence along their preferred direction.},

	Abstract = {This chapter addresses an open problem in visual motion analysis, the estimation of image motion in the vicinity of occlusion boundaries. With a Bayesian formulation, local image motion is explained in terms of multiple, competing, nonlinear models, including models for smooth (translational) motion and for motion boundaries. The generative model for motion boundaries explicitly encodes the orientation of the boundary, the velocities on either side, the motion of the occluding edge over time, and the appearance/disappearance of pixels at the boundary. We formulate the posterior probability distribution over the models and model parameters, conditioned on the image sequence. Approximate inference is achieved with a combination of tools: A Bayesian filter provides for online computation; factored sampling allows us to represent multimodal {non-Gaussian} distributions and to propagate beliefs with nonlinear dynamics from one time to the next; and mixture models are used to simplify the computation of joint prediction distributions in the Bayesian filter. To efficiently represent such a high-dimensional space, we also initialize samples using the responses of a low-level motion-discontinuity detector. The basic formulation and computational model provide a general probabilistic framework for motion estimation with multiple, nonlinear models.},

@article{Neuhofer09,
	Abstract = {Like most other spiders Cupiennius salei (Keyserling 1877) has two different eye types, one pair of principal eyes and three pairs of secondary eyes. The principal eyes have two eye muscles each, which allow movement of the retina and are mainly used for the discrimination of stationary objects. The secondary eyes without such eye muscles are supposed to detect moving objects. Masking experiments were used to analyse the role of these two eye types in motion detection. In a white arena the animals were stimulated with short sequences of moving black bars. The principal eyes move involuntarily when objects are moving within the visual field of an ipsilateral secondary eye. The eye muscle activity of the principal eyes was recorded using single channel telemetry, and activity changes were taken as an indicator for the perception of motion. Masking the principal eyes with black paint and presenting a moving visual stimulus did not modify the induced muscle activity, whereas masking the secondary eyes eliminated the increase in eye muscle activity. This suggests that the secondary eyes are responsible for movement detection. We conclude that the animals are able to detect moving targets visually only with the secondary eyes. The principal eyes, by contrast, do not seem to be involved in the detection of moving targets. 10.1242/jeb.027136},

This approach has been highly fruitful in the ongoing effort to understand velocity computation by the primate visual system. This Review describes the success of spatiotemporal-energy models in representing local-velocity detection. It shows why local-velocity measurements tend to differ from the velocity of the object as a whole. Certain cells in the middle temporal area are thought to solve this problem by combining local-velocity estimates to compute the overall pattern velocity. The Review discusses different models for how this might occur and experiments that test these models. Although no model is yet firmly established, evidence suggests that computing pattern velocity from local-velocity estimates involves simple operations in the spatiotemporal frequency domain.},

@article{Prado-Martin09a,
	Abstract = {I present a new approach for the interpretation of reaction time ({RT}) data from behavioral experiments. From a physical perspective, the entropy of the {RT} distribution provides a model-free estimate of the amount of processing performed by the cognitive system. In this way, the focus is shifted from the conventional interpretation of individual {RTs} being either long or short, into their distribution being more or less complex in terms of entropy. The new approach enables the estimation of the cognitive processing load without reference to the informational content of the stimuli themselves, thus providing a more appropriate estimate of the cognitive impact of different sources of information that are carried by experimental stimuli or tasks. The paper introduces the formulation of the theory, followed by an empirical validation using a database of human {RTs} in lexical tasks (visual lexical decision and word naming). The results show that this new interpretation of {RTs} is more powerful than the traditional one. The method provides theoretical estimates of the processing loads elicited by individual stimuli. These loads sharply distinguish the responses from different tasks. In addition, it provides upper-bound estimates for the speed at which the system processes information. Finally, I argue that the theoretical proposal, and the associated empirical evidence, provide strong arguments for an adaptive system that systematically adjusts its operational processing speed to the particular demands of each stimulus. This finding is in contradiction with Hick's law, which posits a relatively constant processing speed within an experimental context.},

@article{Prado-Martin09,
	Abstract = {Response latency -- the time taken to initiate or complete an action or task -- is one of the principal measures used to investigate the mechanisms subserving human and animal cognitive processes. The right tails of response latency distributions have received little attention in experimental psychology. This is because such very long latencies have traditionally been considered irrelevant for psychological processes, instead, they are expected to reflect `contingent' neural events unrelated to the experimental question. Most current theories predict the right tail of response latency distributions to decrease exponentially. In consequence, current standard practice recommends discarding very long response latencies as `outliers'. Here, I show that the right tails of response latency distributions always follow a power-law with a slope of exactly two. This entails that the very late responses cannot be considered outliers. Rather they provide crucial information that falsifies most current theories of cognitive processing with respect to their exponential tail predictions. This exponent constitutes a fundamental constant of the cognitive system that groups behavioral measures with a variety of physical phenomena.},

	Abstract = {A neural field model is presented that captures the essential non-linear characteristics of activity dynamics across several millimeters of visual cortex in response to local flashed and moving stimuli. We account for physiological data obtained by voltage-sensitive dye ({VSD}) imaging which reports mesoscopic population activity at high spatio-temporal resolution. Stimulation included a single flashed square, a single flashed bar, the line-motion paradigm \^{a}€ '' for which psychophysical studies showed that flashing a square briefly before a bar produces sensation of illusory motion within the bar \^{a}€ '' and moving squares controls. We consider a two-layer neural field ({NF}) model describing an excitatory and an inhibitory layer of neurons as a coupled system of non-linear integro-differential equations. Under the assumption that the aggregated activity of both layers is reflected by {VSD} imaging, our phenomenological model quantitatively accounts for the observed spatio-temporal activity patterns. Moreover, the model generalizes to novel similar stimuli as it matches activity evoked by moving squares of different speeds. Our results indicate that feedback from higher brain areas is not required to produce motion patterns in the case of the illusory line-motion paradigm. Physiological interpretation of the model suggests that a considerable fraction of the {VSD} signal may be due to inhibitory activity, supporting the notion that balanced intra-layer cortical interactions between inhibitory and excitatory populations play a major role in shaping dynamic stimulus representations in the early visual cortex.},

Such a decision is made through continuous and bidirectional interactions between the environment surrounding the brain and its internal state or dynamical processes. Therefore, decision making may provide a unique field of researches for studying information processing by the brain, a biological system open to information exchanges with the external world. To make a decision, the brain must analyze pieces of information given externally, past experiences in a similar situation, possible behavioral responses, and predicted outcomes of the individual responses.

The particle filter technique is adopted and modified to fit into the multi-target tracking framework. A rectification technique is employed to find the correspondence between the video frame coordinates and the standard hockey rink coordinates so that the system can compensate for camera motion and improve the dynamics of the players. A global nearest neighbor data association algorithm is introduced to assign boosting detections to the existing tracks for the proposal distribution in particle filters. The mean-shift algorithm is embedded into the particle filter framework to stabilize the trajectories of the targets for robust tracking during mutual occlusion. Experimental results show that our system is able to automatically and robustly track a variable number of targets and correctly maintain their identities regardless of background clutter, camera motion and frequent mutual occlusion between targets.},

We investigated the extrapolation of contour shape by human vision. Measurements of extrapolation position and orientation were taken at six distances from the point of occlusion, thereby yielding a detailed representation of the extrapolated contours. Analyses of these measurements revealed that: (i) extrapolation curvature increases linearly with the curvature of the inducing contour, although there is individual bias in the slope; (ii) the precision with which an extrapolated contour is represented is roughly constant, in angular terms, with increasing distance from the point of occlusion; (iii) there is a substantial cost of curvature, in that the overall precision of an extrapolated contour decreases systematically with curvature; (iv) the shapes of visually extrapolated contours are characterized by a nonlinear decrease in curvature, asymptoting to zero; and (v) this decaying pattern of curvature is explained by a Bayesian model in which, with increasing distance from the point of occlusion, the prior tendency to minimize curvature gradually dominates the likelihood tendency to minimize variation in curvature.},

Our contribution is to show how a Markov random field motion prior, built on the fly at each time step, can model these interactions to enable more accurate tracking. We present results for a social insect tracking application, where we model the domain knowledge that two targets cannot occupy the same space, and targets will actively avoid collisions. We show that using this model improves track quality and efficiency. Unfortunately, the joint particle tracker we propose suffers from exponential complexity in the number of tracked targets. An approximation to the joint filter, however, consisting of multiple nearly independent particle filters can provide similar track quality at substantially lower computational cost.},

@article{Perrett09,
	Abstract = {This paper relates human perception to the functioning of cells in the temporal cortex that are engaged in high-level pattern processing. We review historical developments concerning (a) the functional organization of cells processing faces and (b) the selectivity for faces in cell responses. We then focus on (c) the comparison of perception and cell responses to images of faces presented in sequences of unrelated images. Specifically the paper concerns the cell function and perception in circumstances where meaningful patterns occur momentarily in the context of a naturally or unnaturally changing visual environment. Experience of visual sequences allows anticipation, yet one sensory stimulus also masks perception and neural processing of subsequent stimuli. To understand this paradox we compared cell responses in monkey temporal cortex to body images presented individually, in pairs and in action sequences. Responses to one image suppressed responses to similar images for \&sim;500 ms. This suppression led to responses peaking 100 ms earlier to image sequences than to isolated images (e.g., during head rotation, face-selective activity peaks before the face confronts the observer). Thus forward masking has unrecognized benefits for perception because it can transform neuronal activity to make it predictive during natural change.},

	Abstract = {This paper considers prediction and perceptual categorization as an inference problem that is solved by the brain. We assume that the brain models the world as a hierarchy or cascade of dynamical systems that encode causal structure in the sensorium. Perception is equated with the optimization or inversion of these internal models, to explain sensory data. Given a model of how sensory data are generated, we can invoke a generic approach to model inversion, based on a free energy bound on the model's evidence. The ensuing free-energy formulation furnishes equations that prescribe the process of recognition, i.e. the dynamics of neuronal activity that represent the causes of sensory input. Here, we focus on a very general model, whose hierarchical and dynamical structure enables simulated brains to recognize and predict trajectories or sequences of sensory states. We first review hierarchical dynamical models and their inversion. We then show that the brain has the necessary infrastructure to implement this inversion and illustrate this point using synthetic birds that can recognize and categorize birdsongs.},

@article{Lages10,
	Abstract = {It is shown that existing processing schemes of {3D} motion perception such as interocular velocity difference, changing disparity over time, as well as joint encoding of motion and disparity, do not offer a general solution to the inverse optics problem of local binocular {3D} motion. Instead we suggest that local velocity constraints in combination with binocular disparity and other depth cues provide a more flexible framework for the solution of the inverse problem. In the context of the aperture problem we derive predictions from two plausible default strategies: (1) the vector normal prefers slow motion in {3D} whereas (2) the cyclopean average is based on slow motion in {2D}. Predicting perceived motion directions for ambiguous line motion provides an opportunity to distinguish between these strategies of {3D} motion processing. Our theoretical results suggest that velocity constraints and disparity from feature tracking are needed to solve the inverse problem of {3D} motion perception. It seems plausible that motion and disparity input is processed in parallel and integrated late in the visual processing hierarchy.},

@article{Reis10,
	Abstract = {Animals have developed a range of drinking strategies depending on physiological and environmental constraints. Vertebrates with incomplete cheeks use their tongue to drink; the most common example is the lapping of cats and dogs. We show that the domestic cat (Felis catus) laps by a subtle mechanism based on water adhesion to the dorsal side of the tongue. A combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that Felis catus exploits fluid inertia to defeat gravity and pull liquid into the mouth. This competition between inertia and gravity sets the lapping frequency and yields a prediction for the dependence of frequency on animal mass. Measurements of lapping frequency across the family Felidae support this prediction, which suggests that the lapping mechanism is conserved among felines.},

@article{Goodman10,
	Abstract = {Spike timing is precise in the auditory system and it has been argued that it conveys information about auditory stimuli, in particular about the location of a sound source. However, beyond simple time differences, the way in which neurons might extract this information is unclear and the potential computational advantages are unknown. The computational difficulty of this task for an animal is to locate the source of an unexpected sound from two monaural signals that are highly dependent on the unknown source signal. In neuron models consisting of spectro-temporal filtering and spiking nonlinearity, we found that the binaural structure induced by spatialized sounds is mapped to synchrony patterns that depend on source location rather than on source signal. Location-specific synchrony patterns would then result in the activation of location-specific assemblies of postsynaptic neurons. We designed a spiking neuron model which exploited this principle to locate a variety of sound sources in a virtual acoustic environment using measured human head-related transfer functions. The model was able to accurately estimate the location of previously unknown sounds in both azimuth and elevation (including front/back discrimination) in a known acoustic environment. We found that multiple representations of different acoustic environments could coexist as sets of overlapping neural assemblies which could be associated with spatial locations by Hebbian learning. The model demonstrates the computational relevance of relative spike timing to extract spatial information about sources independently of the source signal.},

Cognitive theories about the positive symptoms of schizophrenia --- hallucinations and delusions --- have tended to treat perception and belief formation as distinct processes. However, recent advances in computational neuroscience have led us to consider the unusual perceptual experiences of patients and their sometimes bizarre beliefs as part of the same core abnormality --- a disturbance in error-dependent updating of inferences and beliefs about the world. We suggest that it is possible to understand these symptoms in terms of a disturbed hierarchical Bayesian framework, without recourse to separate considerations of experience and belief.},

More precisely, we focus our interest on the limit behaviour of the network when its size grows to infinity with bounded time. In the case of gaussian connection weights, we use the same techniques as Ben Arous and Guionnet (see [3]) to prove that the image law of the distribution of the neurons' activation states by the empirical measure satisfies a temperature free large deviation principle. Moreover, we prove that if the connection weights satisfy a general condition of domination by gaussian tails, then the distribution of the activation potential of each neuron converges weakly towards an explicit gaussian law, the characteristics of which are contained in the mean-field equations stated by {Cessac-Doyon}-{Quoy-Samuelides} (see [4--6]). Furthermore, under this hypothesis, we obtain a law of large numbers and a propagation of chaos result. Finally, we show that many classical distributions on the couplings fulfill our general condition. Thus, this paper provides rigorous mean-field results for a large class of neural networks which is currently investigated in neural network literature.},

	Abstract = {Recent experimental work has suggested that the neural firing rate can be interpreted as a fractional derivative, at least when signal variation induces neural adaptation. Here, we show that the actual neural spike-train itself can be considered as the fractional derivative, provided that the neural signal is approximated by a sum of power-law kernels. A simple standard thresholding spiking neuron suffices to carry out such an approximation, given a suitable refractory response. Empirically, we find that the online approximation of signals with a sum of power-law kernels is beneficial for encoding signals with slowly varying components, like long-memory self-similar signals. For such signals, the online power-law kernel approximation typically required less than half the number of spikes for similar {SNR} as compared to sums of similar but exponentially decaying kernels. As power-law kernels can be accurately approximated using sums or cascades of weighted exponentials, we demonstrate that the corresponding decoding of spike-trains by a receiving neuron allows for natural and transparent temporal signal filtering by tuning the weights of the decoding kernel.},

                How the brain encodes information in population activity, and how it combines and manipulates that activity as it carries out computations, are questions that lie at the heart of systems neuroscience. During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.

@article{Sepulcre10,
	Abstract = {
                Information processing in the human brain arises from both interactions between adjacent areas and from distant projections that form distributed brain systems. Here we map interactions across different spatial scales by estimating the degree of intrinsic functional connectivity for the local (<or=14 mm) neighborhood directly surrounding brain regions as contrasted with distant (>14 mm) interactions. The balance between local and distant functional interactions measured at rest forms a map that separates sensorimotor cortices from heteromodal association areas and further identifies regions that possess both high local and distant cortical-cortical interactions. Map estimates of network measures demonstrate that high local connectivity is most often associated with a high clustering coefficient, long path length, and low physical cost. Task performance changed the balance between local and distant functional coupling in a subset of regions, particularly, increasing local functional coupling in regions engaged by the task. The observed properties suggest that the brain has evolved a balance that optimizes information-processing efficiency across different classes of specialized areas as well as mechanisms to modulate coupling in support of dynamically changing processing demands. We discuss the implications of these observations and applications of the present method for exploring normal and atypical brain function.

Single cells in brain regions thought to underlie object recognition code for many stimulus aspects, which poses a limit on their invariance. Combining the responses of multiple non-invariant neurons via weighted linear summation offers an optimal decoding strategy, which may be able to achieve invariant object recognition. However, because object identification is essentially parameter optimization in this model, the characteristics of the identification task trained to perform are critically important. If this task does not require invariance, a neural population-code is inherently more selective but less tolerant than the single-neurons constituting the population. Nevertheless, tolerance can be learned - provided that it is trained for - at the cost of selectivity. We argue that this model is an interesting null-hypothesis to compare behavioral results with and conclude that it may explain several experimental findings.},

	Abstract = {Sensory information about the outside world is encoded by neurons in sequences of discrete, identical pulses termed action potentials or spikes. There is persistent controversy about the extent to which the precise timing of these spikes is relevant to the function of the brain. We revisit this issue, using the motion-sensitive neurons of the fly visual system as a test case. Our experimental methods allow us to deliver more nearly natural visual stimuli, comparable to those which flies encounter in free, acrobatic flight. New mathematical methods allow us to draw more reliable conclusions about the information content of neural responses even when the set of possible responses is very large. We find that significant amounts of visual information are represented by details of the spike train at millisecond and sub-millisecond precision, even though the sensory input has a correlation time of \~{}55 ms; different patterns of spike timing represent distinct motion trajectories, and the absolute timing of spikes points to particular features of these trajectories with high precision. Finally, the efficiency of our entropy estimator makes it possible to uncover features of neural coding relevant for natural visual stimuli: first, the system's information transmission rate varies with natural fluctuations in light intensity, resulting from varying cloud cover, such that marginal increases in information rate thus occur even when the individual photoreceptors are counting on the order of one million photons per second. Secondly, we see that the system exploits the relatively slow dynamics of the stimulus to remove coding redundancy and so generate a more efficient neural code.},

@article{Chandrasekaran09,
	Abstract = {Humans, like other animals, are exposed to a continuous stream of signals, which are dynamic, multimodal, extended, and time varying in nature. This complex input space must be transduced and sampled by our sensory systems and transmitted to the brain where it can guide the selection of appropriate actions. To simplify this process, it's been suggested that the brain exploits statistical regularities in the stimulus space. Tests of this idea have largely been confined to unimodal signals and natural scenes. One important class of multisensory signals for which a quantitative input space characterization is unavailable is human speech. We do not understand what signals our brain has to actively piece together from an audiovisual speech stream to arrive at a percept versus what is already embedded in the signal structure of the stream itself. In essence, we do not have a clear understanding of the natural statistics of audiovisual speech. In the present study, we identified the following major statistical features of audiovisual speech. First, we observed robust correlations and close temporal correspondence between the area of the mouth opening and the acoustic envelope. Second, we found the strongest correlation between the area of the mouth opening and vocal tract resonances. Third, we observed that both area of the mouth opening and the voice envelope are temporally modulated in the 2\^{a}€ '' 7 Hz frequency range. Finally, we show that the timing of mouth movements relative to the onset of the voice is consistently between 100 and 300 ms. We interpret these data in the context of recent neural theories of speech which suggest that speech communication is a reciprocally coupled, multisensory event, whereby the outputs of the signaler are matched to the neural processes of the receiver.},

@article{Ma06,
	Abstract = {Recent psychophysical experiments indicate that humans perform near-optimal Bayesian inference in a wide variety of tasks, ranging from cue integration to decision making to motor control. This implies that neurons both represent probability distributions and combine those distributions according to a close approximation to Bayes' rule. At first sight, it would seem that the high variability in the responses of cortical neurons would make it difficult to implement such optimal statistical inference in cortical circuits. We argue that, in fact, this variability implies that populations of neurons automatically represent probability distributions over the stimulus, a type of code we call probabilistic population codes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Poisson-like variability observed in cortex reduces a broad class of Bayesian inference to simple linear combinations of populations of neural activity. These results hold for arbitrary probability distributions over the stimulus, for tuning curves of arbitrary shape and for realistic neuronal variability.},

@article{Freeman10,
	Abstract = {During smooth pursuit eye movement, observers often misperceive velocity. Pursued stimuli appear slower ({Aubert-Fleishl} phenomenon [1, 2]), stationary objects appear to move (Filehne illusion [3]), the perceived direction of moving objects is distorted (trajectory misperception [4]), and self-motion veers away from its true path (e.g., the slalom illusion [5]). Each illusion demonstrates that eye speed is underestimated with respect to image speed, a finding that has been taken as evidence of early sensory signals that differ in accuracy [4, 6-11]. Here we present an alternative Bayesian account, based on the idea that perceptual estimates are increasingly influenced by prior expectations as signals become more uncertain [12-15]. We show that the speeds of pursued stimuli are more difficult to discriminate than fixated stimuli. Observers are therefore less certain about motion signals encoding the speed of pursued stimuli, a finding we use to quantify the {Aubert-Fleischl} phenomenon based on the assumption that the prior for motion is centered on zero [16-20]. In doing so, we reveal an important property currently overlooked by Bayesian models of motion perception. Two Bayes estimates are needed at a relatively early stage in processing, one for pursued targets and one for image motion.},

Often there is no one correct answer, but instead one that is favoured simply because it is more likely to lead to reward. A variety of probabilistic classification tasks probe the covert strategies that humans use to decide among alternatives based on evidence that bears only probabilistically on outcome. Here we show that rhesus monkeys can also achieve such reasoning. We have trained two monkeys to choose between a pair of coloured targets after viewing four shapes, shown sequentially, that governed the probability that one of the targets would furnish reward. Monkeys learned to combine probabilistic information from the shape combinations. Moreover, neurons in the parietal cortex reveal the addition and subtraction of probabilistic quantities that underlie decision-making on this task.},

Consequently, homeostatic mechanisms are necessary to ensure stable neuronal and network function over an animal's lifetime. To understand how these homeostatic mechanisms might function, it is crucial to understand how tightly regulated synaptic and intrinsic properties must be for adequate network performance, and the extent to which compensatory mechanisms allow for multiple solutions to the production of similar behaviour. Here, we use examples from theoretical and experimental studies of invertebrates and vertebrates to explore several issues relevant to understanding the precision of tuning of synaptic and intrinsic currents for the operation of functional neuronal circuits.},

@article{Turrigiano04,
	Abstract = {Activity has an important role in refining synaptic connectivity during development, in part through 'Hebbian' mechanisms such as long-term potentiation and long-term depression. However, Hebbian plasticity is probably insufficient to explain activity-dependent development because it tends to destabilize the activity of neural circuits. How can complex circuits maintain stable activity states in the face of such destabilizing forces? An idea that is emerging from recent work is that average neuronal activity levels are maintained by a set of homeostatic plasticity mechanisms that dynamically adjust synaptic strengths in the correct direction to promote stability. Here we discuss evidence from a number of systems that homeostatic synaptic plasticity is crucial for processes ranging from memory storage to activity-dependent development.},

@article{Iliopoulos10,
	Abstract = {The observed cooperation on the level of genes, cells, tissues, and individuals has been the object of intense study by evolutionary biologists, mainly because cooperation often flourishes in biological systems in apparent contradiction to the selfish goal of survival inherent in Darwinian evolution. In order to resolve this paradox, evolutionary game theory has focused on the Prisoner's Dilemma ({PD}), which incorporates the essence of this conflict. Here, we encode strategies for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma ({IPD}) in terms of conditional probabilities that represent the response of decision pathways given previous plays. We find that if these stochastic strategies are encoded as genes that undergo Darwinian evolution, the environmental conditions that the strategies are adapting to determine the fixed point of the evolutionary trajectory, which could be either cooperation or defection. A transition between cooperative and defective attractors occurs as a function of different parameters such as mutation rate, replacement rate, and memory, all of which affect a player's ability to predict an opponent's behavior. These results imply that in populations of players that can use previous decisions to plan future ones, cooperation depends critically on whether the players can rely on facing the same strategies that they have adapted to. Defection, on the other hand, is the optimal adaptive response in environments that change so quickly that the information gathered from previous plays cannot usefully be integrated for a response.},

In this document we review phenomenological models of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity, in particular spike-timing dependent plasticity ({STDP}). The aim of the document is to provide a framework for classifying and evaluating different models of plasticity. We focus on phenomenological synaptic models that are compatible with integrate-and-fire type neuron models where each neuron is described by a small number of variables. This implies that synaptic update rules for short-term or long-term plasticity can only depend on spike timing and, potentially, on membrane potential, as well as on the value of the synaptic weight, or on low-pass filtered (temporally averaged) versions of the above variables. We examine the ability of the models to account for experimental data and to fulfill expectations derived from theoretical considerations. We further discuss their relations to teacher-based rules (supervised learning) and reward-based rules (reinforcement learning). All models discussed in this paper are suitable for large-scale network simulations.},

@article{Thivierge10,
	Abstract = {Detecting the temporal relationship among events in the environment is a fundamental goal of the brain. Following pulses of rhythmic stimuli, neurons of the retina and cortex produce activity that closely approximates the timing of an omitted pulse. This omitted stimulus response ({OSR}) is generally interpreted as a transient response to rhythmic input and is thought to form a basis of short-term perceptual memories. Despite its ubiquity across species and experimental protocols, the mechanisms underlying {OSRs} remain poorly understood. In particular, the highly transient nature of {OSRs}, typically limited to a single cycle after stimulation, cannot be explained by a simple mechanism that would remain locked to the frequency of stimulation. Here, we describe a set of realistic simulations that capture {OSRs} over a range of stimulation frequencies matching experimental work. The model does not require an explicit mechanism for learning temporal sequences. Instead, it relies on spike timing-dependent plasticity ({STDP}), a form of synaptic modification that is sensitive to the timing of pre- and post-synaptic action potentials. In the model, the transient nature of {OSRs} is attributed to the heterogeneous nature of neural properties and connections, creating intricate forms of activity that are continuously changing over time. Combined with {STDP}, neural heterogeneity enabled {OSRs} to complex rhythmic patterns as well as {OSRs} following a delay period. These results link the response of neurons to rhythmic patterns with the capacity of heterogeneous circuits to produce transient and highly flexible forms of neural activity.},

	Abstract = {How does an infant learn through visual experience to imitate actions of adult teachers, despite the fact that the infant and adult view one another and the world from different perspectives? To accomplish this, an infant needs to learn how to share joint attention with adult teachers and to follow their gaze towards valued goal objects. The infant also needs to be capable of view-invariant object learning and recognition whereby it can carry out goal-directed behaviors, such as the use of tools, using different object views than the ones that its teachers use. Such capabilities are often attributed to '' mirror neurons''. This attribution does not, however, explain the brain processes whereby these competences arise. This article describes the {CRIB} (Circular Reactions for Imitative Behavior) neural model of how the brain achieves these goals through inter-personal circular reactions. Inter-personal circular reactions generalize the intra-personal circular reactions of Piaget, which clarify how infants learn from their own babbled arm movements and reactive eye movements how to carry out volitional reaches, with or without tools, towards valued goal objects. The article proposes how intra-personal circular reactions create a foundation for inter-personal circular reactions when infants and other learners interact with external teachers in space. Both types of circular reactions involve learned coordinate transformations between body-centered arm movement commands and retinotopic visual feedback, and coordination of processes within and between the What and Where cortical processing streams. Specific breakdowns of model processes generate formal symptoms similar to clinical symptoms of autism.},

	Abstract = {The ability to represent interval timing is crucial for many common behaviors, such as knowing whether to stop when the light turns from green to yellow. Neural representations of interval timing have been reported in the rat primary visual cortex and we have previously presented a computational framework describing how they can be learned by a network of neurons. Recent experimental and theoretical results in entorhinal cortex have shown that single neurons can exhibit persistent activity, previously thought to be generated by a network of neurons. Motivated by these single neuron results, we propose a single spiking neuron model that can learn to compute and represent interval timing. We show that a simple model, reduced analytically to a single dynamical equation, captures the average behavior of the complete high dimensional spiking model very well. Variants of this model can be used to produce bi-stable or multi-stable persistent activity. We also propose a plasticity rule by which this model can learn to represent different intervals and different levels of persistent activity.},

@article{Martiniuc10,
	Abstract = {The estimation of motion direction from time varying retinal images is a fundamental task of visual systems. Neurons that selectively respond to directional visual motion are found in almost all species. In many of them already in the retina direction selective neurons signal their preferred direction of movement. Scientific evidences suggest that direction selectivity is carried from the retina to higher brain areas. Here we adopt a simple integrate-and-fire neuron model, inspired by recent work of Casti et al. (2008), to investigate how directional selectivity changes in cells postsynaptic to directional selective retinal ganglion cells ({DSRGC}). Our model analysis shows that directional selectivity in the postsynaptic cells increases over a wide parameter range. The degree of directional selectivity positively correlates with the probability of burst-like firing of presynaptic {DSRGCs}. Postsynaptic potentials summation and spike threshold act together as a temporal filter upon the input spike train. Prior to the intricacy of neural circuitry between retina and higher brain areas, we suggest that sharpening is a straightforward result of the intrinsic spiking pattern of the {DSRGCs} combined with the summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials and the spike threshold in postsynaptic neurons.},

@article{Vicente11,
	Abstract = {Understanding causal relationships, or effective connectivity, between parts of the brain is of utmost importance because a large part of the brain's activity is thought to be internally generated and, hence, quantifying stimulus response relationships alone does not fully describe brain dynamics. Past efforts to determine effective connectivity mostly relied on model based approaches such as Granger causality or dynamic causal modeling. Transfer entropy ({TE}) is an alternative measure of effective connectivity based on information theory. {TE} does not require a model of the interaction and is inherently non-linear. We investigated the applicability of {TE} as a metric in a test for effective connectivity to electrophysiological data based on simulations and magnetoencephalography ({MEG}) recordings in a simple motor task. In particular, we demonstrate that {TE} improved the detectability of effective connectivity for non-linear interactions, and for sensor level {MEG} signals where linear methods are hampered by signal-cross-talk due to volume conduction.},

@article{Chrostowski10,
	Abstract = {Travelling waves of activity in neural circuits have been proposed as a mechanism underlying a variety of neurological disorders, including epileptic seizures, migraine auras and brain injury. The highly influential {Wilson-Cowan} cortical model describes the dynamics of a network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The {Wilson-Cowan} equations predict travelling waves of activity in rate-based models that have sufficiently reduced levels of lateral inhibition. Travelling waves of excitation may play a role in functional changes in the auditory cortex after hearing loss. We propose that down-regulation of lateral inhibition may be induced in deafferented cortex via homeostatic plasticity mechanisms. We use the {Wilson-Cowan} equations to construct a spiking model of the primary auditory cortex that includes a novel, mathematically formalized description of homeostatic plasticity. In our model, the homeostatic mechanisms respond to hearing loss by reducing inhibition and increasing excitation, producing conditions under which travelling waves of excitation can emerge. However, our model predicts that the presence of spontaneous activity prevents the development of long-range travelling waves of excitation. Rather, our simulations show short-duration excitatory waves that cancel each other out. We also describe changes in spontaneous firing, synchrony and tuning after simulated hearing loss. With the exception of shifts in characteristic frequency, changes after hearing loss were qualitatively the same as empirical findings. Finally, we discuss possible applications to tinnitus, the perception of sound without an external stimulus.},

@article{Turek10,
	Abstract = {Among the many ways to model signals, a recent approach that drawsconsiderable attention is sparse representation modeling. In this model, thesignal is assumed to be generated as a random linear combination of a few atomsfrom a pre-specified dictionary. In this work we analyze two Bayesian denoisingalgorithms -- the {Maximum-Aposteriori} Probability ({MAP}) and {theMinimum}-{Mean-Squared}-Error ({MMSE}) estimators, under the assumption that thedictionary is unitary. It is well known that both these estimators lead to ascalar shrinkage on the transformed coefficients, albeit with a differentresponse curve. In this work we start by deriving closed-form expressions forthese shrinkage curves and then analyze their performance. Upper bounds on {theMAP} and the {MMSE} estimation errors are derived. We tie these to the errorobtained by a so-called oracle estimator, where the support is given,establishing a worst-case gain-factor between the {MAP}/{MMSE} estimation errorsand the oracle's performance. These denoising algorithms are demonstrated onsynthetic signals and on true data (images).},

	Abstract = {Self-organizing computational models with specific intracortical connections can explain many functional features of visual cortex, such as topographic orientation and ocular dominance maps. However, due to their computational requirements, it is difficult to use such detailed models to study large-scale phenomenal like object segmentation and binding, object recognition, tilt illusions, optic flow, and fovea-periphery differences. This article introduces two techniques that make large simulations practical. First, we show how parameter scaling equations can be derived for laterally connected self-organizing models. These equations result in quantitatively equivalent maps over a wide range of simulation sizes, making it possible to debug small simulations and then scale them up only when needed. Parameter scaling also allows detailed comparison of biological maps and parameters between individuals and species with different brain region sizes. Second, we use parameter scaling to implement a new growing map method called {GLISSOM}, which dramatically reduces the memory and computational requirements of large self-organizing networks. With {GLISSOM}, it should be possible to simulate all of human V1 at the single-column level using current desktop workstations. We are using these techniques to develop a new simulator Topographica, which will help make it practical to perform detailed studies of large-scale phenomena in topographic maps.},

@article{Ahissar98,
	Abstract = {Peripheral sensory activity follows the temporal structure of input signals. Central sensory processing uses also rate coding, and motor outputs appear to be primarily encoded by rate. I propose here a simple, efficient structure, converting temporal coding to rate coding by neuronal phase-locked loops ({PLL}). The simplest form of a {PLL} includes a phase detector (that is, a neuronal-plausible version of an ideal coincidence detector) and a controllable local oscillator that are connected in a negative feedback loop. The phase detector compares the firing times of the local oscillator and the input and provides an output whose firing rate is monotonically related to the time difference. The output rate is fed back to the local oscillator and forces it to phase-lock to the input. Every temporal interval at the input is associated with a specific pair of output rate and time difference values; the higher the output rate, the further the local oscillator is driven from its intrinsic frequency. Sequences of input intervals, which by definition encode input information, are thus represented by sequences of firing rates at the {PLL}'s output. The most plausible implementation of {PLL} circuits is by thalamocortical loops in which populations of thalamic "relay" neurons function as phase detectors that compare the timings of cortical oscillators and sensory signals. The output in this case is encoded by the thalamic population rate. This article presents and analyzes the algorithmic and the implementation levels of the proposed {PLL} model and describes the implementation of the {PLL} model to the primate tactile system.},

@article{Aertsen89,
	Abstract = {1. We reexamine the possibilities for analyzing and interpreting the time course of correlation in spike trains simultaneously and separably recorded from two neurons. 2. We develop procedures to quantify and properly normalize the classical joint peristimulus time scatter diagram. These allow separation of the "raw" correlation into components caused by direct stimulus modulations of the single-neuron firing rates and those caused by various types of interaction between the two neurons. 3. A newly developed significance test ("surprise") is applied to evaluate such inferences. 4. Application of the new procedures to simulated spike trains allowed the recovery of the known circuitry. In particular, it proved possible to recover fast stimulus-locked modulations of "effective connectivity," even if they were masked by strong direct stimulus modulations of individual firing rates. These procedures thus present a clearly superior alternative to the commonly used "shift predictor." 5. Adopting a model-based approach, we generalize the classical measures for quantifying a direct interneuronal connection ("efficacy" and "contribution") to include possible stimulus-locked time variations. 6. Application of the new procedures to real spike trains from several different preparations showed that fast stimulus-locked modulations of "effective connectivity" also occur for real neurons.},

We find a good qualitative and quantitative match between the set of learned functions trained on image sequences and the population of complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). The functions show many properties found also experimentally in complex cells, such as direction selectivity, non-orthogonal inhibition, end-inhibition, and side-inhibition. Our results demonstrate that a single unsupervised learning principle can account for such a rich repertoire of receptive field properties.},

@article{Shahaf08,
	Abstract = {The wide range of time scales involved in neural excitability and synaptic transmission might lead to ongoing change in the temporal structure of responses to recurring stimulus presentations on a trial-to-trial basis. This is probably the most severe biophysical constraint on putative time-based primitives of stimulus representation in neuronal networks. Here we show that in spontaneously developing large-scale random networks of cortical neurons in vitro the order in which neurons are recruited following each stimulus is a naturally emerging representation primitive that is invariant to significant temporal changes in spike times. With a relatively small number of randomly sampled neurons, the information about stimulus position is fully retrievable from the recruitment order. The effective connectivity that makes order-based representation invariant to time warping is characterized by the existence of stations through which activity is required to pass in order to propagate further into the network. This study uncovers a simple invariant in a noisy biological network in vitro; its applicability under in vivo constraints remains to be seen.},

@article{Olshausen96,
	Abstract = {The receptive fields of simple cells in mammalian primary visual cortex can be characterized as being spatially localized, oriented and bandpass (selective to structure at different spatial scales), comparable to the basis functions of wavelet transforms. One approach to understanding such response properties of visual neurons has been to consider their relationship to the statistical structure of natural images in terms of efficient coding. Along these lines, a number of studies have attempted to train unsupervised learning algorithms on natural images in the hope of developing receptive fields with similar properties, but none has succeeded in producing a full set that spans the image space and contains all three of the above properties. Here we investigate the proposal that a coding strategy that maximizes sparseness is sufficient to account for these properties. We show that a learning algorithm that attempts to find sparse linear codes for natural scenes will develop a complete family of localized, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those found in the primary visual cortex. The resulting sparse image code provides a more efficient representation for later stages of processing because it possesses a higher degree of statistical independence among its outputs.},

@article{Smith08,
	Abstract = {The auditory neural code must serve a wide range of auditory tasks that require great sensitivity in time and frequency and be effective over the diverse array of sounds present in natural acoustic environments. It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

@article{Deneve01,
	Abstract = {The brain represents sensory and motor variables through the activity of large populations of neurons. It is not understood how the nervous system computes with these population codes, given that individual neurons are noisy and thus unreliable. We focus here on two general types of computation, function approximation and cue integration, as these are powerful enough to handle a range of tasks, including sensorimotor transformations, feature extraction in sensory systems and multisensory integration. We demonstrate that a particular class of neural networks, basis function networks with multidimensional attractors, can perform both types of computation optimally with noisy neurons. Moreover, neurons in the intermediate layers of our model show response properties similar to those observed in several multimodal cortical areas. Thus, basis function networks with multidimensional attractors may be used by the brain to compute efficiently with population codes.},
